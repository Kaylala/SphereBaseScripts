**INSTALLATION**
****************
**TO INSTALL THIS FACTION SYSTEM Simply use a PLEVEL 7 Account and type .FACTIONSTART 
*This installs 6 scripted Townstones with Faction Relics linked to them.
*This command also makes the 6 towns at WAR with each other and REMOVES normal guarded region flags from the six towns.

***********************
**The 6 WARRING Towns**
***********************
Yew         
Vesper 
Cove 
Minoc 
Skara Brae 
Trinsic 

To find the townstones simply type .GO Yew or .GO Cove , etc....
Players MUST join a Townstone in order to be involved in the Factions. It's completely voluntary.
Players MUST use their townstone to Resign from Factions.
Non-Faction Players may enter Faction Controlled Towns without fear of Faction Guards Attacking.

Other Towns such as Britain and Moonglow have been left out of this system on purpose.
Once you get to know this scripted system, customization should be easy.

********************
**THE RELIC SYSTEM**
********************
**There are a total of 7 Possible Realm Points that can be possessed by any given Faction.
**Each Town has a Relic attatched (and linked) to it's Townstone, and starts with 1 Realm Point.
**THERE SHOULD NEVER BE MORE SIX REALM POINTS DIVIDED BETWEEN THE TOWNS!
**Once a Relic reaches 0 Realm Points, it becomes Corrupt, and is unstealable.

An enemy Faction Member must have minimum of 55 stealing to attempt theft of the item.
Once a Town Relic is stolen by an enemy Faction, it is redeemed at their Faction Townstone by 
Double-Clicking it. This will transfer ONE Realm Point to their Townstone, and remove ONE from
the other.
IF the redemption of the relic increases Town A's 'Realm Points' > Town B's 'Realm Points',
Town B's region will immediately become under Town A's guard system.
Current Faction Guardsystem consists of Faction Guards who will appear and attack enemy faction members.
They also decay 1-2 minutes after they are spawned.

*********************
**THE SEVENTH RELIC**
*********************
**Control of this relic will award the owner Faction their SEVENTH REALM POINT.
**The "Seventh Relic" is the "Shard Relic" and is used to Unify the Realm and establish complete
shard control by any one faction at a time.
**This relic is only stealable by a faction member who's Stealing is at 95 minimum, and has SIX
Realm Points on his Faction Stone.
**Once this is redeemed at their Townstone, It will Unify the Realm, giving them SEVEN Realm Points,
and making their own Town's Relic Invulnerable to theft.
**The Seventh Relic's Home is on the Ancient Pantheon located in Britain, near the starting inn.
**The Seventh Relic must be stolen by an enemy Faction to break Shard Unification..

**REALM WARS FAQ**
******************
===========================================================================================
QUESTION 1: What can I do if one of my Faction Stones gets deleted?

ANSWER: Simply type .FIXTrinsic or .FIXCove or .FIXMinoc , etc.... using a PLEVEL 7 Account.
This will add a new Townstone and Relic, and set the stone to war with the other 5 towns.
ALWAYS DOUBLECHECK TOTAL REALM POINTS SPLIT BETWEEN FACTIONS by visiting the stones and
adding up the total Realm Points.
Adjust the MOREX of the new Townstone to 0 to make it have no Realm Points if necessary.

===========================================================================================
QUESTION 2: What can I do if a particular stone is not at war for some reason?

ANSWER: Simply type .TrinsicWAR or .CoveWAR or .MinocWAR, etc... depending on which stone needs 
to be at war with the others, using a PLEVEL 7 Account.

*NOTE* The only reason this would happen is if the stone only had one player member 
(who would be mayor) and they quit or are deleted, with no successor to take his place.
The townstone will remove all wars in this situation, thus you are given .CoveWAR etc...
in order to deal with this problem if it should arise. Once there is a population > 1 player
on the stone, this issue would be ultra rare and should never arise.

===========================================================================================
QUESTION 3: How do I completely remove the faction system once I have installed it?

ANSWER: Simply type .FACTIONCLEAN with a PLEVEL 7 Account.
This will remove the Townstones, region events, and restore Normal Guarded Flags to the Region.
Type .SAVE and close the server.Remove the Sphere_Factions Expansion Folder and restart the server.
