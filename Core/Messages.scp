[COMMENT sphere_msgs]
By default, lines in this file are commented out because the server itself
is handling the message.  If you want to change a message, uncomment the
appropriate line and change it to say what you want.  If you want the message
to not be sent at all, then set the value to "".

After making a change, this script needs to be reloaded, at which point sphere
will replace default message with the one you modified.

NOTE: If the string contains a % character, your string must contain all
      those characters too.
