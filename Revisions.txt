x You put the logss in your pack
x. Also you can smelt Chaos and Order shields to get gold and blackrock ingots in mass amounts with no or little work.
x. Also with the guild stones, you can recruit the guildmaster making him a candidate and 
  take over the guild stone and kick everyone out. Warring guilds tend to make mules and do this sort of thing.
18. Many guild bugs. Players can be "half-way" in a guild now. 
  The result is other waring guilds are now orange to you and 
  you are blue to them. They can be half way in the guild two 
  ways. 
  18.1. Have the guildmaster never accept you fully in. 
  18.2. after the guildmaster accepts you in, don't click the stone. You can actually end up half way in a guild with your guild tag on. 
19. Another guild bug is people will make a charater with 10 str 
  and then join it to a guild thats either Chaos or Order. 
  Then go attack greens, the player will auto attack back and 
  easily kill the player with 10 str. Thusly giving them a kill
  they get guard killed and a near by guildmate loots the corpse of the person that got attacked by the guy with 10 str. No criminal tags are incured on either the looter or the attacker due to the fact that the target was green.

non unicode text is sent back out as unicode text

12-11-2003, Kell
- Added @CallGuards as a propper trigger, "return 1" cancels guards being called
- Changed @Logout so that "return 1" disallows instalogout.
- Added support for the following TAGs on characters:
  TAG.NAME.ALT (alternate name, good for incognito effects)
  TAG.NAME.PREFIX (alternate prefix, if not set, defaults to Notoriety prefix - lady/lord)
  TAG.NAME.SUFFIX (suffix for the name)
  Note that a space isn't added for prefix or suffix on purpose, to allow text to be
  glued to the name. You can add a space by using quotes, as in: TAG.NAME.SUFFIX="text "
- Using open door macro now triggers double click event.
- @DClick is now triggered on NPCs BEFORE attempting to mount, paperdoll or open
backpack ("return 1" cancels)
- If REAPAMOUNT isn't present, AMOUNT/3 will be used (it won't just default to 1).

13-11-2003, Kell
- Player characters with conjured flag get unmounted and the flag removed on death. Useful
to leave no corpse behind ( under ON=@Death : flags = <flags> | statf_conjured ). This would
be better as a server setting.
- Fixed spider webs remaining for days, and spider silk too (increased item count too much)

14-11-2003, Zorm

14-11-2003, Kell
- Fixed parsing of <<args>> or any other nested <var> btw. Also fixed parsing of numerical commands
  (skills) so that <7> actually works for accessing skill #7 (this didn't make it to .55R1).
- Fixed dumb log file being created out of place. Will still happen when Sphere is run as
  an NT service though.

15-11-2003, Zorm
- Added LOS check for taming
- Changed m_defense from BYTE to WORD, thus fixing the bug with AR > 255
- CanSeeLOS fixed, now checks if target object z is greater then myz + 14 if so blocks
- Kill count decay should be fixed
- Can no longer steal from trade windows or game boards
- ATTR_OWNED items may no longer be magic locked
- Added @DeathCorpse, argn1 = corpse?
- Trade window items are now dumped to back before corpse is made
- Now checks accounts when first sent
- Added @start in skilldefs
- Provoking players disabled

16-11-2003, Kell
- Identified problem regarding vanishing horses. Apparently, they stop acting as ridden, so instead
  of deleting them I will just try and restart their behaviour again. If this fails, they still
  shouldn't be deleted, and a new message should be printed out. To test, try creating a horse, mount
  and then worldsave.
- Made sure that ABORTED skills don't hand out experience for failure. Only those that actually fail do.
  ( this fixes lumberjacking / mining exploits ).
- Added support for TAG.NAME.HUE (name colour)
- Added @SkillSelect to character events, and @Select  to SKILLDEFs ("return 1" aborts).
- Added support for FORCHARS/FORITEMS/FOROBJS the correct way: SRC is retained and the default object
  within the FOR block is the object being looped through.
- Added @SkillSuccess to character events, and @Success to SKILLDEFs ("return 1" aborts).
- Changed @SkillStart so that "return 1" actually aborts the skill (same for @Start in SKILLDEFs).
- Changed @Login so that "return 1" disallows logging in.
- Added @UserSkills ("return 1" cancels the skill window being displayed).
- Added @UserStats  ( user requested stats update, return value is ignored )
- DBG: Added @SkillMakeItem to character events, triggered after the item has been created:
  "return 1" deletes the item
  "return 0" bounces the item as usual, but with no extra messages (potion, quality message)
  "return"   bounces the item as usual.

17-11-2003, Kell
- Hopefully fixed the bug with resyncing SPELL sections.
- Added triggers to SPELL sections, so you can now independently code spells:
  @Select ( "return 1" cancels, "return 0" skip checks, "return" default behaviour)
  @Start  ( "return 1" cancels )
  @Fail   ( "return 1" cancels the fizzle effect).
  @Success
- Changed SERV.LOG to allow writing of messages to the log. New syntax is:
  serv.log @enable   -- enables logging
  serv.log @disable  -- disable logging
  serv.log @toggle   -- toggles logging
  serv.log text      -- log text to console and file

18-11-2003, Zorm
- Fixed commands going to npcs, as well as more problems with unicode speech
  support - BROKEN
- CGTypedArray, SetCount, DestroyElements, crashes on shutdown. Needs more
  work to fix
- Fame gain fixed

18-11-2003, Kell
- Moved tags to CObjBase so all types of objects can have tags. Removed special
  handling of TAGs from characters, script items and multi items.
- Fixed problem when resycing SKILL sections (spheretables.scp) would mess up
  Skill_ defnames ( and the ACTION field on characters ). One no longer needs
  to use workarounds like my FIXACTION function. Memory corruption problems
  when resyncing SPELL tables should also be fixed.

18-11-2003, DarkStorm
- Started fixing some issues preventing sphere to compile on linux (CSocket.h)
- Managed to make it compile on Linux, comitted all the changes neccesary and
  made sure it still compiles on windows.
- Implemented some code changes to remove the ncurses dependency on linux and
  activated the console again. 
- Implemented Colors on the Linux Console

19-11-2003, DarkStorm
- Added MD5 Password support via MD5PASSWORDS=1 in sphere.ini. If you activate
  this, accounts will be saved with the password encoded (existing non-encoded
  password will be converted). WARNING: disabling it afterwards won't restore
  the passwords to plain text, and thus you won't be able to login with those
  accounts. Once enabled, and the accounts file saved this setting should not be
  changed (unless you set the passwords by hand).
- Removed the ScriptEngine Folder from the VC++6 project and wrapped an #if
  defined() around the three functions that used it. It seems unused in the
  productive gameserver, so i think we can remove the additional 400kb of
  possibly error prone code.
- Removed the ScriptEngine Folder from the VC++ 7 project too
- Changed the VC++ 6 projects to use the shared CRT. (It's shipped with windows
  since 95)
- Rewrote the new[], new, delete and delete[] operators and removed the memory
  footprinting. 
- Tuned the optimizations for VS.NET 2003 Release mode a bit.
- Removed the StatusReports from ntservice.cpp before it loads the ini for now
  Reporting as a service if you aren't a service isn't supposed to be happening,
  there needs to be a better fix than mine (maybe a -service argument?)
- added a check to CAccount to filter out accounts named "eof"
- fixed the help provided by .serv.accounts

19-11-2003, Kell
- Added a .DBG command, to put test code in. At the moment it'll be used to try
  and crash the server in various ways, to see how it behaves on Linux.

20-11-2003, Kell
- Added INTERRUPT=X,Y to SPELL sections in spheretable_x.scp. This controls
  the chance to fizzle a spell when hit in combat, at different Magery levels.
  Default is 100.0, 100.0 (always fizzle). With a setting of "100.0 50.0" a GM
  mage would only fizzle half the times.
- NPCs equipping stuff that is too heavy for them on @NPCRestock won't
  spit hundreds of errors to the console.
- Added LOSTNPCTELEPORT=X to sphere.ini. If X is greater than 0, NPCs that have
  a HOME point set will now teleport home if the distance to their HOME is above
  X. This fixes it when they go through portals, then get lost in the map.
- Fixed problem with mounted NPCs dying and leaving a lingering object which
  could leak later.
- FINALLY made it crash resistant under Linux - it is now trapping most
  signals AND launching exceptions correcly. Tested with a single thread
  (FREEZERESTARTTIME=0 in sphere.ini) and no background saving. More tests
  to come.
- Changed the loading procedure so sphere.ini is loaded prior to any message
  being printed to the log file. This allows the LOG= line to be parsed and
  log files to be created in the appropriate folder, so to make sure, LOG=
  line should be among the first in sphere.ini
- Changed the Linux makefile to include the necessary exception flags.
- "return 1" from a skill's @Start or @Success trigger doesn't trigger @Fail. If you
  do want @Fail triggered, set ACTION=-1. This is compatible with .55i scripts, because
  seeing as "return 1" didn't work there, scripts which did mean for @Fail to be triggered
  should already be using ACTION=-1

21-11-2003, Kell
- Linux version now works with secondary threads (FREEZERESTARTTIME not 0),
  and is able to restart the main loop if it freezes.
- Added a toggle to sphere.ini, "EXPERIMENTAL", to allow setting flags
  which enable several experimental features. You will see these referenced
  in the changelog as EF 0x????.
- EF 0x0001 enables a packet fix for Linux servers, for XCMD_Spy. Enable this
  if your clients get a login error.
- EF 0x0002 enables new UNICODE fixes.
- EF 0x0004 enables zorm CanSeeLOS fix. This is required, seeing as that fix
  won't allow you to cast uphill - a minor problem, but worth having a flag to
  toggle that behaviour.
- EF 0x0008 disables interruption of fight skills if the ACT changes. This
  fixes scripts that re-implement combat, and cases where combat with multiple
  enemies would break swings.
- EF 0x0010 enables the INTERRUPT field in SPELL sections. INTERRUPT=100.0 100.0
  SHOULD yield the standard always fail behaviour, as should not having an 
  INTERRUPT line at all. But seeing as this wasn't fully tested, you MUST enable
  this flag to make any use of the interrupt values.
- Suggested value for EXPERIMENTAL field in sphere.ini is:
  EXPERIMENTAL=013

22-11-2003, Kell
- LOSTNPCTELEPORT now checks for homedist, and won't teleport if the NPCs are still
  within home-distance. This allows you to have low values.
- Further stability fixes for Linux version, it should now work fine with background
  world saves.

22-11-2003, Zorm
- Added login crypt keys for clients up to 3.0.3, must add support for packets up to
  0xCC or atleast lengths.
- I think I fixed unicode speech now

22-11-2003, Kell
- Attempted to fix the bug where setting ACT in a @Hit trigger stops
  the swing, by restoring it after the trigger.
- Added SKIPDIFFICULTY (0 by default, or 1) to SKILL sections. Setting it to 1
  skips the hardcoded difficulty check and allows one to do their own skill difficulty
  checks in @Success, and "return 1" in there for a failure.
- Fixed @Select triggers which return 1 leaving the character waiting for an action.

23-11-2003, Zorm
- Experimental Precasting support, enable with experimental flag EF_Precast (flag 020),
  this is not well tested - it's a work in progress. Included here just for the sake of
  getting feedback.

24-11-2003, Kell
- SERV.SPELL(x).yyy, where x is the number of the spell and yyy is a key from the
  SPELLs section, such as MANAUSE or RESOURCES. You can also use RESCAST for a
  descriptive name of resources (much like RESMAKE works for items).
- SERV.SKILL(x).yyy, where x is the skill number and yyy is a key from the SKILLs
  section, such as KEY or TITLE.
- Experimented with breaking SKILL and SPELL sections to seperate files, loading them
  off-order and reloading, no problems found. Notice however that files containing
  SPELL sections must load after the base items (like spheretable_x does).

25-11-2003, Kell
- Changed it so NPCs with SPIRITSPEAK equal or above 100.0 are able to see dead players,
  like healers can. That allows one to use ON = @NPCSeeNewPlayer and an human brain to
  implement NPCs that interact with the dead, without having to put up with healer's
  default behaviour.
- Added flag NORESROBE to sphere.ini. If set to 1, players will not be given a robe
  when resurrected.

26-11-2003, Kell
- Changed SERV.SPELL and SERV.SKILL so that they accept either number or defname
  (SKILL also accepts plain names, like <SERV.SKILL(Magery).TITLE>)
- SERV.ITEMDEF(x).yyy to access data from ITEMDEF sections (similar to the above)
- SERV.CHARDEF(x).yyy to access data from CHARDEF sections (similar to the above)

27-11-2003, Kell
- On the brink of release, fixed a serious problem inherited from .55j where unknown
  keywords being evaluated would *silently* come out untouched. As an example,
  '<SERV.NONEXISTANT>' would silently come out as '<SERV.NONEXISTANT>' instead of ''
  as in .55i. If used with tags, it could end up getting weird values and make it hard
  to catch the error, as no error was being shown. It now returns '' for stuff it can't
  evaluate, BUT also prints an error in the console. I believe this is the best possible
  behaviour.
- Linux version is now declared stable. A minor problem still exists, in that pressing
  CTRL-C in the console is not a good way to terminate the server, and will very likely
  get it into a loop. This is a minor problem though, still trying to solve it. Test
  servers report uptimes of 2-3 days with 10-20 players online (that's all the testing
  I could do).
- Added CANMAKESKILL to test ONLY for the ability to make an item skillwise (it ONLY
  tests the SKILLMAKE line), not resources.
- Added "fval", which works exactly like "eval", but formats the output in x.x format.
- There seems to be an issue with skills that use @Success to cancel a skill, in that
  sometimes the skill won't be registered as finished, and using the skill again will
  show the "you must wait" message. Players can just double-tap TAB to overcome this,
  or you can use ACTION=-1 to force skill termination. Need some feedback on this, as
  this behaviour might actually be due to bad scripts, so feel free to post comments.
- Many issues with the default

30-11-2003, Zorm
- Fixed text going all uppercase sometimes and gm body commands.

01-12-2003, Kell
- Added @EquipTest and @ItemEquipTest (return 1 cancels equiping).
- Changed @SkillItemMake so that "return 1" only deletes the item if it's container hasn't
  been set.
- Fixed bug with skills apparently not finishing (also fixes cartography).
- Fixed summoning bug (Linux only). This has to do with doing propper memory initialization
  prior to using points.
- Removed all specific handling for SERV.xxx(y).zzz and made it generic. You can now use
  either syntax: SERV.xxx(y).zzz or SERV.xxx.y.zzz.
- Changed default release options for speed optimization.

02-12-2003, Kell
- Fixed REAPAMOUNT / AMOUNT. It can now take multi-point values in a format similar to
  ADVANCE for skills.
- Added SPEECHSELF= to sphere.ini, to allow setting the name of the speech trigger that
  should be called to intercept player speech. Suggested: SPEECHSELF=spk_player
  "return 1" in said trigger stops the player from actually talking.
- Removed hard coded "home home home" - one can just use the default spk_player speech if
  that feature is desired (but mostly it's not)
- Added SPEECHPET= to sphere.ini, to allow setting the name of the speech trigger that
  is called when a pet listens to its master. "return 1" in said trigger stops the pet
  from listenning.

---- 0.55 R3 rc1 --------------------------------------------------------------
---- 08/01/2004

09-12-2003
- Added TAGs to CHARDEF/ITEMDEF sections. If a TAG does exists at an instance it overrides
  the def value.

10-12-2003, Kell
- Added OptionFlags to sphere.ini, to set multiple options. These will be named OF_
- Added OF_Magic_IgnoreAR = 0001, so that AR doesn't count to stop damage spells.
- Added ACTDIFF to characters to obtain the current action difficulty.
  Suggestion: One can use ACTDIFF to modify difficulty within skill Start triggers.
- Added a 6th parameter to the EFFECT command, the hue for the effect.
- Added @Effect trigger to spells, triggered after @SpellEffect
- <TAG0.xxx> can now be used to assume "0" as the default value for a tag.
- TAG0.xxx = yyy can now be used, if yyy is 0, then no tag will be recorded (same as setting
  to a zero length string)
  Using TAG0, you can thus have tags that are only recorded if they are not 0. This is great
  for tags that are usually 0 and are often used (e.g. tags that must exist on all characters).
- Added VAR0 (same functionality as TAG0, but for VAR).

11-12-2003, Kell
- Added OF_Magic_CanHarmSelf = 0002, so that spells with SPELLFLAG_HARM will still affect the
  caster (useful for SPELLEFFECT in scripts)
- Changed rand(x) to allow a 2nd parameter rand(x,y) and return a random number between x and y,
  if y is present.

12-12-2003, Kell
- You can now use @color,font in SYSMESSAGE and MESSAGE. font ranges from 0 to 9, and I quote:
      FONT_BOLD,  // 0 - Bold Text = Large plain filled block letters.
      FONT_SHAD,  // 1 - Text with shadow = small gray
      FONT_BOLD_SHAD, // 2 - Bold+Shadow = Large Gray block letters.
      FONT_NORMAL,  // 3 - Normal (default) = Filled block letters.
      FONT_GOTH,  // 4 - Gothic = Very large blue letters.
      FONT_ITAL,  // 5 - Italic Script
      FONT_SM_DARK, // 6 - Small Dark Letters = small Blue
      FONT_COLOR, // 7 - Colorful Font (Buggy?) = small Gray (hazy)
      FONT_RUNE,  // 8 - Rune font (Only use capital letters with this!)
      FONT_SM_LITE, // 9 - Small Light Letters = small roman gray font.
- Changed SKILLMAKE to allow getting an individual resource in the list. SKILLMAKE.1 gets the first,
  SKILLMAKE.1.VAL gets the value and SKILLMAKE.1.KEY gets the associated resource key.

13-12-2003, Kell
- Added "RELEASE" to character verbs, does the same as "release" when spoke to a pet.
- Added @NPCFollow trigger, called when an NPC is following someone.

14-12-2003, Kell
- Changed ATTACK to accept as parameter the UID of the character to attack.
- Changed TRY to make no plevel or touch/distance checks. Use TRYP if you want those checks
  (TRYP 0 only checks for touch/distance, not plevel).
- Added an useful keyword to scripts, that allows one to use "OBJ" as pointer to an item. It's
  similar to ACT but it can be used anywhere. 
  Example:
     OBJ  = <UID>
     SAY You are <OBJ.NAME>, with uid <OBJ.UID>.
- Changed MEMORY to allow an UID as parameter, so you can now find the memory related to a specific
  UID. If no argument is used, it uses SRC's UID as usual. Also changed it to be read/write.
  Example:
     MEMORY <SRC.UID> 0200  // set memory 
     SAY Memory flag regarding <UID> is <MEMORY.<SRC.UID>>.

15-12-2003, Kell
- Changed @UserSkills so that <argn1> is the number of the skill being updated, or -1 for the skill
  list. This allows one to stop sending of skill updates to the client.
- NPCs will not say "Yes Master" if SPEECHPET is set in sphere.ini (you can script it in the speech
  triggers if you want them to). If SPEECHPET isn't set, they still won't say anything unless they
  can see their master (which is great for GMs). Players will no longer respond "Sorry".
- Resource gathering was changed so that the SKILLMAKE of the resource item is checked. Resources
  which fail the canmake check are ignored and aren't part of the randomization process. If for some
  reason one wants to go back to the old style, just comment SKILLMAKE on the ore itemdefs.
- Added OF_Skill_DiffFirst = 0008. With this flag turned on, difficulty for a skill is calculated BEFORE
  calling @Start/@SkillStart. This has the advantage of allowing the difficulty for a skill to be changed
  via ACTDIFF within that trigger. Notice that for a skill to fail, ACTDIFF must be set above the current
  (modified) skill. Setting ACTDIFF to a negative value means that the skill will abort, that is, @Fail
  will not be called and no skill gain will be attempted. To always fail set ACTDIFF to a value above the
  possible skill (say, 1001).
  This has the sideffect of calling @SpellCast before @Start/@SkillStart. On the other hand, it is the
  ultimate tool for implementing your own skill difficulties.
  Here's an example of making the difficulty for arms lore AT LEAST the same value as for making the item
  (using the primary skill). Characters with skill above ACTDIFF will always succeed.
  ON = @Start
   if ( <SRC.ACTDIFF> < <SRC.ACT.SKILLMAKE.1.VAL> )
      SRC.ACTDIFF = <SRC.ACT.SKILLMAKE.1.VAL>
   endif

16-12-2003, Kell
- You can now use NEWITEM, NEWNPC and NEWDUPE in item scripts, the items will be created into "NEW". Using
  these commands on a character will create the items in both NEW and ACT. If you want to use these
  on a character without changing ACT, use SERV.NEWITEM, etc.
  Example:
    NEWITEM i_gold
    NEW.AMOUNT 100
    NEW.P = <TOPOBJ.P>
  You can also use NEW as a temporary handler, much like you can use OBJ (and to an extenct, ACT).

17-12-2003, Kell
- Functions can now receive "args" when being evaluated, as in <SRC.myfunction Say hello>
- Added RANGE=min,max or RANGE=max (min defaults to 0) for ITEMDEF and CHARDEF. Default weapon range
  is 1. Default character range is 1. Range is calculated as (character + weapon -1). 
  Example: Assuming all characters are RANGE=1 (which they are), putting RANGE=2 in an halberd
  means characters equipping it can hit 1 square further.

18-12-2003, Kell
- The main section for DIALOGs is now fully interpreted like other scripts, allowing you to add logic
  to your dialog, use IFs, etc. The only limitation at the moment is that gump commands are only 
  allowed right in the DIALOG section, and not within FUNCTIONs, but hei... it's better. :)
- Dialogs will no longer conflict with each other, this allows for permanent on-screen dialogs. INPDLG
  works too, seeing as there can be only one INPDLG window onscreen at all times.
- Added RESOURCES.n, RESOURCES.n.KEY and RESOURCES.n.VAL to items/characters.

19-12-2003, Kell
- To make writing dialogs easier, added a cursor and relative coordinates:
     dorigin 50 50  // sets the origin to x=50, y=50
  Using "*" near a coordinate makes it relative to the origin, and displaces the origin by some amount:
     dtext     *0    *10    0    the origin is now x=50 y=60, so is the last location
  Using "+" near a coordinate makes it relative to the last location w/o changing the origin.
     dtext     +10     -    0    adds 10 to X (y=150, o.y=100)
  As an example, imagine writing a list of text with 3 columns, each seperated via 200 x and 20 space
  between each row:
  dorigin 10 10
  // first row
  dtext     *0   -    5   1:
    dtext  +10   -    0   the text for row1, col1
  dtext   *200   -    5   2:    // x orig = 200
    dtext  +10   -    0   the text for row1, col2
  dtext   *200   -    5   3:    // x orig = 400
    dtext  +10   -    0   the text for row1, col2

  And now one only has to go down one row. and the text is quite similar. This isn't too easy to explain, it's
  there for whomever might find it useful. If you can't think of a use for it, just ignore it. ;)
- Fixed the bug with FORCHARS/ITEMS/OBJS and keywords starting with "FOR" (like FORensics).
- Changed textadd and gumptext to collapse equal strings of text to the same index. So if you use
    gumptext 10 20  This is an example.
    gumptext 10 40  This is an example.
    gumptext 10 60  This is an example.
  It will only generate ONE text id. This does away with the need to have a seperate TEXT section. Granted,
  such a section is still useful for keeping strings all in one place (in this case it'd be useful), but it
  is no longer mandatory, it becomes simply a matter of style/choice.

20-12-2003, Kell
- Equal PLEVEL should be able to see each other, so they are now.
- You can now open a dialog in a specific page, with DIALOG  d_dialog_name  pagenumber. This isn't actually
  possible with the UO client - what it does is recalculate the dialog page/button numbers so that the selected
  page is first. It's completly invisible though, and works perfectly.
- Added a new command - DTEXT - to gumps, which does the handling of text ids for you (d stands for dynamic):
     dtext x y color  Actual text comes here.
  Text added with gumptext is actually added to the [DIALOG ... TEXT] section. If you're only using a given
  text string once, then it's actually faster using this than using "text" and adding it to the TEXT section
  of the dialog. Simmilar commands, DCROPPEDTEXT and DTEXTENTRY are also in, also taking text instead of an
  index. DHTMLGUMP is also in, but notice that the syntax is like HTMLGUMP, except that you ommit the ID and add
  the text in the end.
  With these changes, you can completly ommit the [DIALOG ... TEXT] section of dialogs. Only those strings
  that are commonly used throughout the dialog should you put in the [DIALOG ... TEXT] section.
  Internally, both gumptext and textadd simply add stuff to the dialog as needed, and send normal "text"
  commands to the client, so they're safe to use. But they free you from having to keep track of a LONG
  list of numbers, and allow you to shape and modify your dialog w/o bothering with text ids.
- You can now use FUNCTIONs that issue gump commands. So you actually make your own gump commands!!! Death to
  copy & paste dialogs!

21-12-2003, Kell
- Fixed a bug in that setting stats & skills via scripts wouldn't correctly parse things. For instance, numerical
  expressions.
- Started work on MANUAL.TXT, to detail the current state of things like triggers and their arguments, seeing as
  reading this changelog is probably a difficult task for a lot of people.
- Changed args in functions to be writeable. This is useful in scripts, but for triggers, the server will read
  back the values and use the new ones wherever it makes sense. For the time being, these triggers were
  changed:
     @GetHit, ARGN1 is the damage being apllied, ARGN2 the damage type (as usual, but now writeable). 
     @Hit, ARGN1 is now the raw damage being applied, prior to armour (writeable). ARGO is the weapon (if any).
     @PersonalSpace, ARGN1 is the stamina required to move (writeable). "return 1" stops the movement, "return 0"
     allows the movement but shows none of the hard-coded messages. Plain "return" or no return, works as standard.
  @Hit, @HitTry and @HitMiss were also changed so that ARGO is the weapon being used (handy so you don't have to
  be looking at layers n stuff).
  I should add that ACTDIFF is also available, and it can be used to change the difficulty of a skill, even make
  a skill succedd that would otherwise fail (by setting it to 0). It can also be used in @HitTry now, and if
  set to any non-negative value, a missing hit will instead succeed.
- Added StrEat function, which removes a word up to the space, from a string (<streat("hello there friend")>
  or <streat hello there friend> return "there friend")
- Added <SERV.LOOKUPSKILL skill name> which returns the skill number for some text or -1 if not found.
- After some beta-testing, a few fixes to dialogs.
- LOCAL.xxx within functions for LOCAL . They're a bit more efficient on servers with lots of global
  vars due to faster lookups ). LOCAL variables always come up initially as "0".
- ARGN1, ARGN2 and ARGN3 are set for functions with numeric arguments. So whenever possible, use these instead
  of argv. Example: "myfunction  123 50 89" - these 3 values will be parsed into argn1, argn2 and argn3

22-12-2003, Kell
- Functions can now return strings using "return". Notice that this behaves like TAGs, in that if you do
     return 2+2
  then "2+2" is returned, and not "4". You'll have to explicitly call "eval" on what you want
  to return:
     return <eval (2+2)>
  Returning strings causes no extra lag, seeing as the old method of returning a value relied on the same
  string which is returned (EVALed). So it is actually faster (although hardly noticeable).
  This might pose a problem problem if you have "return rand" or similar, instead of "return <eval rand..."
  seeing as multiple uses of the return value re-evaluate it, generating a new random number - again,
  similar to TAGs.
  MAKE SURE YOU HAVE "EVAL" on your "return" lines, wherever you want the result of a calculation to be
  returned. The next version will probably not have an EF_ReturnString flag.

- Modified the profiling function to keep track of average consumption over time. The average time is
  calculated each second as 90% of the previous average time plus 10% the current time. This poses some
  resistence to spikes. 
- Added a new keyword to @Create / @NPCRestock and template scripts: FULLINTERP. Set FULLINTERP=1 to allow the
  use of functions, ifs, etc. Example:
  ON = @NPCRestock
     ITEM=i_cape
     FULLINTERP
        ITEM=i_robe
        MY_FUNCTION_CALL
  You can use FULLINTERP 0 to disable the feature, after you've enabled it, but it's usually pointless, seeing as
  this FULLINTERP affects only the remainder of the current script. Bear in mind that the usual restrictions apply,
  seeing as the created NPC is not ingame yet.

23-12-2003, Kell
- Added access to TERRAIN and STATICS either via P.key, MOREP.key or SERV.MAP(x,y).key, with key being one of:
    TERRAIN The terrain ID
    ISDIRT  Checks the terrain ID to see if it's dirt.
    ISGRASS guess
    ISROCK  dunno
    ISWATER guess again
    STATICS Number of statics in the position
    STATICS(n)  ID of static Nth static ( eg: <SERV.MAP(200,300).STATICS(0)>. Shows no error in the console
    if static isn't present, returning 0 - useful to test for a static w/o counting or looping.
    STATICS.n   same
    STATICS(n).key  Get a key from the appropriate ITEMDEF. eg: <SERV.MAP(200,300).STATICS(0).NAME>

- Added basic iterator construct, WHILE, with the following syntax:
     WHILE ( condition )
  // do stuff, current iteration number in <LOCAL._WHILE>
     END // or ENDWHILE

  also added FOR, terminated with either END or ENDFOR, with the following syntax:

     FOR 5  // loops from 0 to 5, current iteration number in LOCAL._FOR
  or FOR 3 5  // loops from 3 to 5, current iteration number in LOCAL._FOR
  or FOR K 5  // loops from 0 to 5, current iteration number in LOCAL.K
  or FOR K 3 5  // loops from 3 to 5, current iteration number in LOCAL.K
  // do stuff
     END  // or ENDFOR

  Changing these LOCAL variables has no effect on the loop.
- Wrote a small assembly function to access the high resolution timer. Works for both windows and Linux,
  now being used in profiling. Profiling works on Linux now. It also looks a lot better in the console
  thanks to the monospaced font.
- Changed the console font under Windows to Courier, which is monospaced, so things come out aligned in
  the console. Under Linux, the console is naturally monospaced.
- You can now add new SKILL sections, up to 70. SERV.MAXSKILL tells you how many skills are loaded. Notice
  that they won't be sent to the client though, the client doesn't support them (hint: @UserSkills). There
  is also a FLAGS key for SKILL section, with the following values:
     [DEFNAME skill_defs]
     SKF_SCRIPTED 01  // no hardcoded behaviour, only triggers are called.
     // feel free to add new tags you find useful, but only above 01000 please, to make room for future
     expansion
  This is heavily experimental, mess with it at your own risk.
- SKILLSELECT skill - force a button select event on the skill list

24-12-2003, Kell
- Fixed TYPEDEFS section in spherefs.scp loosing values when resynced.
- Added <CANMOVE dir>, takes a direction as argument (like WALK), returns the area ID we're moving to,
  or 0 if no move is possible.
- Added <MOVE dir>, takes a direction as argument (like WALK), returns the TILE flags for that position.
  Notice that flag 04 is walkable. Here's a list of flags, you can copy&paste it into spheredefs.scp. This
  keyword might change in the future.


[DEFNAME tile_flags]      // by Shadowlord
tilef_background  01    // No idea. None whatsoever. Maybe it's the blackness.
tilef_weapon    02    // I smack thee with this here ... club?
tilef_transparent 04    // Yeah. So we can see through it?
tilef_translucent 08    // Okay...
tilef_wall    010   // Hey look, we can't walk through it!
tilef_damaging    020   // Lava, perhaps? Fires, hmm!
tilef_impassable  040   // Mountains and stuff, I'll wager.
tilef_wet   080   // Water? Or mud? Or a slick road in a rainstorm? Probably the first.
tilef_unknown   0100    // Uh...
tilef_surface   0200    // Tables or something?
tilef_bridge    0400    // I wonder why they'd have a flag for that.
tilef_stackable   0800  
tilef_window    01000   // So we can see/shoot out?
tilef_noshoot   02000   // ? We can't shoot out or something? So, like a glass window maybe?
tilef_prefixA   04000   // A card
tilef_prefixAn    08000   // An apple
tilef_internal    010000    // hair, beards, etc
tilef_foliage   020000    // Probably bushes and tree leaves and stuff.
tilef_partialHue  040000    // semi-glowy?
tilef_unknown_1   080000    // Well, gee. I should see if it's used on anything...
tilef_map   0100000   // Sounds good to me.
tilef_container   0200000   // They flag these!?
tilef_wearable    0400000   // Omigod!
tilef_lightSource 0800000   // I'm getting tired of typing repetitive shiznit now.
tilef_animated    01000000  // Like fire again. And stuff. Those spinny propeller thingies!
tilef_noDiagonal  02000000  // !?!???!!?
tilef_unknown_2   04000000  // I really hope some of these unknowns are n/w/s/e facing flags.
tilef_armor   08000000  // Armor, okay, so does that count shields? Hmmm?
tilef_roof    010000000 // "Don't fall through me!" Or why isn't it just flagged surface or something?
tilef_door    020000000 // Okay...
tilef_stairBack   040000000 // Don't we have stairs that go forward or left too? This could cover both...
tilef_stairRight  080000000 // Well, whatever, you can climb them, so, hey... Good use for a 

NOTE :  EF flags change from version to version, so make SURE you're using only the EF
  flags you want, if any.

- It's Xmas! So I'm off to eat some turkey for the next 48 hours. :) Does this count as an entry in the
  changelog?

27-12-2003, Kell
- Added support for color & render mode in EFFECT. If no color or render effect are specified, old
  effect packet is still sent (which spares 8 bytes). Otherwise the new packet type is sent. Tested
  and works with clients from 2.0.3 (should work on all 2.0.* series).
- Consolidated support for 3.0.* clients, they should work fine, up to LBR (they already worked, just
  spitted some error messages).
- Added modulus (%) operator in numerical expressions (eg: 12 % 3 == 0).
- Added SENDPACKET command for clients. To make it easier to send WORD(2 bytes) and DWORD(4 bytes) values, 
  allowed for 'W' and 'D' prefix to values ('B' is also supported for byte but it's redundant). Here's an
  example, of setting light level:
     SRC.SENDPACKET   04e  D<SRC.UID>  20
  Both 04e and 20 could use the prefix B, but notice how <SRC.UID> uses the prefix D to specify it takes
  the space of a DWORD (4 bytes). So much for complex scripts to break multi-byte stuff in bytes :p
  Notice also that each of the parameters is evaluated and truncated, and only then used. For instance,
  if you put 0fffffffe (which obviously isn't a byte) in place of a BYTE, what you'll get is effectively
  0fe. If you put (2+2) it'll be evaluated to "4" before being used.

28-12-2003, Kell
- Added OSTR, ODEX, OINT.
- Added MODSTR, MODDEX, MODINT - spells affect these.
- STR, DEX and INT are always equal to O + MOD (for the relevant stat). If you have OSTR=50, MODSTR=0 and
  then do STR=60, you will get MODSTR=10 (and OSTR unchanged). 
  *** CHANGED *** read the entry for 19-01-2004
- Added MAXHITS/MAXMANA/MAXSTAM. If set to 0, it defaults to the base max stat (eg, MAXSTR defaults to STR).
  MAX always contains MOD for the appropriate stat. That is to say that if you have MAXHITS=100 and MODSTR=10
  then internally it'll be recorded as MAXHITS being 90, and if MODSTR changes, so does MAXHITS. This makes
  it coherent for stat spells, seeing as they not only change your stats but also max hits/stam/mana.
  To make hits depend on STR again, use
     MAXHITS =  // don't use a value
- You can now write TAGs on accounts. Both TAG and TAG0 are available.
- LOCAL._WHILE fixed, within WHILE loops.
- Changed dialog BUTTON sections to allow 
     ON = min max
  to grab any button with buttonID between min and max (including). Also, argn1 is the buttonID that
  actually got selected (even when specify just a buttonID and not a range, as usual). With the buttonID
  in argn1 you can write more generic functions with little fuss.

29-12-2003, Kell
- Fixed some skills not getting currectly terminated when another skill was used before they finished. An
  example of this is Spells not fizzling when a skill was used before spell ended.
- For skills, @Fail is now only triggered when failure occured due to normal circumstances (eg, failed
  difficulty). @Abort is called when failure occurs due to a situation that aborts the skill, such as
  using a new skill before finishing the previous one or an invalid circumstance.
  If @Fail is triggered, it means that the character will still get a skillcheck for failure (skill raise
  through failure), but if you do a "return 1" in there, it won't (check MANUAL.TXT).
- Started implementing propper behaviour for EF_CanSeeLOS. At the moment, it'll check the height of static
  items in the path to the target.
- The use of "SECTOR" to access keywords related to sector is now mandatory. So, to access "light" or
  "rainchance", SRC.RAINCHANCE used to work, you must do SRC.SECTOR.RAINCHANCE. This has several
  advantages - people usually already use SECTOR anyway, so this makes for faster faster execution of
  commands on characters, seeing as it has less things to try. It is also more coherent.

30-12-2003, Kell
- Fixed a small problem with KARMA/FAME that had the huge effect of blocking the client once it got different
  than 0.
- Added FEATURES= to sphere.ini, to define the features the server will enable on the clients upon connection:
   0001 - (T2A) enables chatbutton
   0002 - (LBR) enables LBR sound (plays MP3s instead of MIDI)
   0004 - (T2A) enables T2A update
   0008 - (LBR) enables LBR update (shows monsters)
  Standard .55i automatically enabled 0001 - but you could disable it.
- DIALOGCLOSE command. First argument is the dialog name, second argument is the button that should be
  triggered on the dialog - 0 if not specified. (eg: DIALOGCLOSE d_my_dialog).
  You can put this as one of the first commands in a DIALOG section, to ensure there is only one dialog of
  that type on the client.

02-01-2004, Kell
- Added connection control keywords to sphere.ini - a value of 0 disables
  any of these settings. These settings are not dumb proof. Make sure you
  know what you're doing if you set these:
  * ConnectingMax=x, where x is the maximum number of clients that can coexist
      in non-game state (http, login, etc). Older clients that are not ingame
      get disconnected when new ones come in. Default: 24
  * ConnectingMaxIP=x, as above, but per IP. Only a maximum of x simultaneous
      "not in game" connections will be allowed per IP. Notice that HTTP
      requests for instance, count as "not in game". Default: 8
  * ClientMaxIP=x, maximum number of connections per IP. This is intended to
      stop flooders, DO NOT SET THIS TOO LOW, or you risk looking stupid. There
      are MANY situations where connections can appear as comming from the same
      IP - a common one is people connecting from cybercaffes. Default: 0
- Fixed a serious bug where login errors (Bad Login) could leave a lingering
  socket. This happened because sockets were made invalid so that they'd get
  closed on the next read cycle, therefore losing all information about the
  socket. Clients are now flagged for disconnection, and socket handling is
  done when clients are freed.
  This means that there should always be a "disconnected" message to pair
  with a "connected" message.
- You will see two numbers after the IP in connected/disconnected messages.
  The first is the number of connections from that IP which are not in-game,
  whereas the second is the total number of connections from that IP.
- In savefiles, OSTR and MODSTR are now saved instead of STR. If "STR" is found,
  it'll be interpreted as OSTR. This works fine to convert old worldfiles, even
 if you have spells, because once they wear off they'll simply make your MODSTR
  negative. This works for all stats obviously (simply using STR as an example).
- Changed it so that the first time you set a stat on an NPC, if the Ostat is 0,
  it'll update Ostat not MODstat. In other words, and as an example, if you do
  STR=20 in @Create, you'll end up with OSTR=20 and MODSTR=0. If you then do
  STR=30 on the same NPC, you'll end up with OSTR=20 and MODSTR=10. 
  **** changed **** see the entry for 19-01-2003
- Fixed a small problem from R3.13 with stat affecting spells not setting MODstat
  correctly.

03-01-2004, Kell
- Added unary operators "*=", "+=", "-=", "/=", "%=", "|=", "&=" and "!=". Internally,
  what these actually do is change a line in the format:
    XXX += YYY
  to
    XXX = <eval (<XXX> + (YYY))>
  So you can do stuff like
    MANA  += 10/2     // same as MANA = <eval (<MANA> + (10/2))>
    ATTR  &= ~attr_magic    // same as ATTR = <eval (<ATTR> & (~attr_magic))>
- Added ".=" operator, to do string concatenation. Internally what it does is change a line
  in the format
    XXX .= YYY
  to
    XXX = <XXX>YYY
  This is intended to be used with things that can support strings (NAME, TITLE, VAR, LOCAL, etc)
- First attempt to implement propper LOS check counting with z. To have LOS, you must be
  able to walk in a straight line to the target (no news here) AND finish at a reasonable
  height, climbing your way to it. So, if you're on a slope you might have LOS, but if
  you're standing one floor below you won't. These extra texts have no measurable impact on
  performance Enable this behaviour with EF_CanSeeLos (04).
- Diagonal walking (eg, NW) is allowed only if the character can move ortogonally in both
  directions (NW -> N and W). This takes care of a few clientside exploits, as well as NPCs
  walking through corners. Enable this behaviour with EF_DiagonalWalkCheck (010)
- For the effect of stepping on them, all items were considered to have a height of 3. If you
  are standing higher than 3 above an item, you wouldn't trigger a step on it. Changed it so that
  if the item's height is above 3, that value is used, and not the hardcoded "3". This allows
  one to get @Step events on stuff like tables.
- If no SRC is defined at the time of a @SpellEffect trigger, then the character subject to the
  spell will be considered the SRC. This fixes SPELLEFFECT under @Timer triggers.
- Added @NPCLookAtChar and @NPCLookAtItem triggers (check the manual). Do not abuse of these
  triggers, as they will affect the CPU usage.

04-01-2004, Kell
- Added ISNEARTYPE, first argument is type, 2nd argument is max distance to search ( if not
  specified, 4 is the default ). Also added ISNEARTYPE.P, which returns "0" if false or the
  point coordinates if true.
- Changed DISTANCE to accept the UID of an object (item/char) to compare the distance, or a
  point. One can now write things like
     <DISTANCE <MOREP>>  <DISTANCE trinsic>  <DISTANCE <SRC.ACT.UID>>
  If no argument is supplied, then SRC.UID is used (as default). If the point/UID is invalid
  an error is printed to the console.
- Made TIMERD readable (its precision is 10x that of TIMER, same scale of SERV.TIME).
- Made USEITEM not check for visibility. The whole purpose of this keyword is to allow
  activating an item via scripts w/o testing for touch, so it doesn't make sense to test
  if the item can be seen. DCLICK performs the usual tests though. The "USE" keyword already
  allowed one to do "USE 0" not to test for touch, but it also tested for visibility, and it
  won't anymore if used like "USE 0".
- Spawns gems now instantly update the display as soon as you set MORE1.
- Double clicking an already negated (more2=0) character spawn sets its timer to 1 so it
  respawns next turn.
- Added MOVENEAR keyword for objects(items/chars). 1st argument is the UID of item to move
  near to, 2nd argument is the distance to the item. If 3rd argument is present and "0",
  then the item will not send an Update. Example:
     ON = @DClick
        MOVENEAR <SRC.UID> 5  // move to 5 steps away from SRC
  Notice that this movement respects walls & such (which is why it is useful).
- Set ARGN1=1 in @Login not to show MOTD scroll.

05-01-2004, Kell
- Fixed possible exploit with \n and textentry and inpdlg.
- AREA and ROOM sections in the following format
     [AREA name here]
  Should now be written as
     [AREADEF a_some_def] // ROOMDEF for rooms
     NAME=name here
  The advantage of this format is that you can resync it w/o having conflicting regions.
  Suggestions:  Keep your areas in different formats in seperate files. Either find a script
    to convert your old format to the new one or slowly convert by hand.
    Move [Teleporters] and [Moongates] to their own files (these can't be resynced).
  Note:   You do NOT have to use the new format. It is, however, strongly suggested, as
    it allows you to change an area without rebooting.
    Any future ability to save things on regions will only be available for regions
    in the new format (or regions that have a DEFNAME).
- Added CALL instruction to invoke a function, but sharing the LOCAL variables with the called
  function. Quite useful when you want to break a function in small pieces that are logically
  yet not functionally seperate. In other words, if you invoke a function with CALL, all your
  LOCAL will be available to the underlying function. Example
    [FUNCTION myfunction1]
       LOCAL.VAL1 = 12
       CALL myfunction2 1, 2    // LOCAL.VAL1 will be available to myfunction2
       // if myfunction2 changes LOCAL.VAL1 it will change here aswell.
  If you do not pass arguments to the called function, then args/argn/argv are also shared,
  and the process is faster than invoking the function w/o CALL. If you pass arguments to the
  function, then only LOCAL is shared, and the process is an infinitesimal amount slower. Not
  noticeable, no real impact, but conceptually slower. 
  This can also be used as <CALL Function ...>, faster without arguments, slower with.
- Recently realized that ALL DEFNAMEs are put into VAR. That means that all itemdefs, chardefs,
  etc have an entry in VAR (try <VAR.i_dagger> ). Now, this is potentially confusing and source
  for many problems:
     1) Whenever you're trying to access a VAR, you go through ALL the existing defnames.
     2) You can accidentally create a var that is also a defname... and oooooops!
  So to cope with this, changed it so that VAR/VAR0 only contains global variables that can be
  modified, whereas DEF/DEF0 contains item defnames and can only be read. The difference in speed
  is visible! EVERY time you were accessing a VAR you'd be searching through an array with a few
  thousand elements. Now each lookup searches only through the variables your scritps have created
  (which even on an extremely scripted shard shouldn't reach a hundred).
  This also makes it possible to identify WHICH variables are supposed to be saved.
  Although this is a huge change internally, it won't affect scripts except in the following
  situation:
     1) You defined a DEFNAME flag in scripts that you then changed during execution. This is
        highly uncommon, but if you decide you need this sort of behaviour just create the create
        the VAR once via scripts, it will be saved to spherevars.scp.
     2) You were accessing DEFNAMEs via VAR. No real reason to do it, seeing as DEFs / VARs can
        be accessed w/o the VAR. prefix.
  If not using DEF or VAR to access a variable, you'll get first the VAR if exists, and then the
  DEF. That means that old behaviour is kept.
- VARs are now saved to spheredata.scp. If that file isn't present at boottime the shard will print
  a warning, but it will continue, and it'll be created on the next save.
- GMPages will now be saved to spheredata.scp. Too many people are interested in parsing these to
  make special stuff (eg webpage interfaces or mirc scripts), so now they won't have to parse the
  whole world to read in this stuff.

06-01-2004, Kell
- Added "S" flag to SENDPACKET, allows one to send strings of characters directly. String is not
  within quotes it stops at the first space. Example
     SENDPACKET 00 S"This is the string to send" 0
     SENDPACKET 00 SUpToTheSpace 0
  If the string must be null terminated, simply put a 0 in there, as above. Otherwise, you'll probably
  need to specify length (strlen function) - depends on packet
- Added new walk limiting code, wildly based on the bit-bucket algorithm used in IP QoS DiffServ
  routers: there is a maximum speed at which you can walk (it's fixed, different walking or foot). If
  you walk faster than that speed, every tenth of second you walk faster than expected is a point you
  loose. Every 10th of second you take above the time expected is a point you win. The number of points
  you start with and the maximum is WALKBUFFER in sphere.ini, and I've tested it with values
  around 40 for good connections and 70 for laggy connections.
  If a player speedwalks, he'll soon drop below 0, and stop moving, then have to compensate with equally
  slow walking periods, like it happens when there's a burst of lag.
  WALKREGEN is the speed at which you regen walk points, in percentage.
  Default values: WALKBUFFER=50   WALKREGEN=25
  Hints:
  WALKBUFFER  lower for more strict control. However, setting it lower also increases the
        chance of limiting someone which is just experiencing lag. Raise this value
      if you lower WALKREGEN.
  WALKREGEN set lower for longer-lasting punishments. It makes sense to lower this value
      if you raise WALKBUFFER.
- Removed some EF_ flags that are no longer necessary seeing as they proved to be harmless. Make sure
  you consult MANUAL.TXT.
- Changed trigger @DropOn_Item and @ItemDropOn_Item to be activated for container items too.
  Activated when item with the trigger is dropped on another item (dropped on something else).
- Added @DropOn_Self and @ItemDropOn_Self, activated when an item is dropped on the item with the
  trigger (something was dropped on self).
- Implemented trigger @DropOn_Char and @ItemDropOn_Char.
- If these triggers fail, will only bounce the item if it's still being dragged. That allows the
  scripts in the triggers to define a new place for item.
- Made sure clients can only drop stuff into the bankbox if they are standing in the place where it
  was opened. This could now be checked within scripts aswell.
- Fixed an Injection exploit regarding accessing the bank away from the place it was opened in.
- Added @SkillGain and @Gain triggers. Check MANUAL.TXT for more info.

07-01-2004, Kell
- Automatically assign a DEFNAME to areas and rooms defined in the old format (AREA / ROOM). This
  defname is built upon the NAME, and is made unique by adding a number to it.
- In the console, you can type "d a" to output all the areas and rooms to a file "map_all.scp". I
  strongly suggest you replace your map with this file, as it'll allow you to finally get rid of the
  old format.
  NOTE: Teleporters and Moongates aren't saved in this file, so you should split those to a different
  file, to allow areas to be resynced.
- It is strongly suggested that you do the above, and get rid of the old format areas/rooms. Doing it
  has the following advantages:
  * Loading will be faster, because the server won't have to try and find a good defname for areas.
  * You can edit areas, and resync (even change their name) with no conflicts.
  * TAGs on areas are only saved for areas that have a valid DEFNAME, so if you do this, TAGs will be
    saved on all your areas.
- Added @Targon_Cancel for items.

---- 0.55 R3 rc2 --------------------------------------------------------------
---- 25/01/2004

08-01-2004, Kell
- Fixed VERBOSE=1 causing a catrazillion errors at boot.
- .CAST and .TELE won't show "bad command" sysmessage when they fail.
- If TRY/TRPY are called with an invalid command, they will send the error to the console and not to
  the player. This is coherent with how scripts should behave.
- Fixed NPCs not starting with max stats when MAXxxx is used.
- Fixed .admin showing only your own IP.

09-01-2004, Kell
- .serv.account unused xxx  delete
- .serv.account add test // missing password will no longer crash
- killing characters with positive karma (actually, it's about commiting a crime, not karma)
- .info not returning to dialog after changing a value (actually, INPDLG wasn't returning to dialog)
- flags on UIDs preserved (040000000 for items, 0d2000000 for skills, etc). GLOBALS renamed to WORLDVARS
  due to this (won't go into details here).
- SERV.LOG fixed.
- Fixed plevel 1 players seeing other plevel 1 hidden players
- Added USEHTTP=0/1 in sphere.ini, to disable/enable the built-in HTTP server.
- Added USEGODPORT=0/1 in sphere.ini, to disable the port opened at +1000. As far as I can tell, there is
  really no purpose for that port except taking in connections, much like the standard port you set. So it
  ships disabled by default.

10-01-2004, Kell
- Fixed a bug where redefining a base type (one in the TYPEDEFS list in spheretables.scp) could lead
  to a crash.
- Added a way to assign a TYPEDEF to a terrain type. This means you can define what terrain types are
  water, for instance. Example:
    [TYPEDEF t_water]
    TERRAIN = 00a8  00ab
    TERRAIN = 0136  0137
  This information is then used by ISNEARTYPE (and it has effect on all the hardcoded behaviour)
  when trying to assert if there's t_water around.
  Notice that ISWATER checks wether a terrain type is t_water, whereas <ISNEARTYPE t_water> would check
  for terrain, statics and dynamic items.
- Changed TYPE when called on an SERV.ITEMDEF.xxx.TYPE to return the typename, and not just a value. So
  when called on an water item it should return t_water, and not "30". This also has affect when using
  STATICS.x.TYPE.
- Fixed not being able to access properties of TARGP, as in <SRC.TARGP.X> or <SRC.TARGP.TERRAIN>.
- Added "TYPE" to the keywords available on a point. It uses the information above to return what item
  type is the terrain at that point. So you can do TARGP.TERRAIN.

11-01-2004, Kell
- Changed .info command to show the type associated with the terrain (t_normal if none).
- Wrote sphere_types.scp - it is a REQUIRED script, as it associates terrain IDs to item types. This
  replaces the old hard-coded behaviour (which by the way, was slower). By replacing it, I see no
  need to keep the old code, seeing as all you need is to have this script, which will be distributed
  from now on.
  Add sphere_types.scp in spheretables.scp right after sphere_defs.scp.
- Removed ISWATER, ISGRASS, ISROCK and ISDIRT commands from points (they were introduced in R3). Please
  use TYPE instead. For instance, use (<P.TYPE> == t_water) wherever you'd use <P.ISWATER>. Some might
  have grown attached to these commands, but unified and coherent scripts are certainly better than
  different methods for doing the same. Besides, this offers a lot more control (e.g.: <P.TYPE> == t_lava)
- Added ISNEARTYPE to the keywords accepted by points. So you can do <SRC.TARGP.ISNEARTYPE t_water> and
  that will effectively test terrain type, statics, and dynamic items. This is probably what most people
  will want to use, seeing as P.TYPE only test for terrain (and not statics or dynamic items).
- Added EF_New_Triggers (010). If set, allows the use of @NPCActFight, @NPCActFollow, @NPCLookAtChar
  and @NPCLookAtItem. This flag was added because even having these triggers *might* have some impact
  upon performance in very busy shards. 
- Removed a "Weird layer" message from whenever you equipped an item to layer_hidden. This is quite an
  useful layer for people wanting to expand their shards, so there's really no reason for this error.

12-01-2004, Kell
- Fixed "b" in console not working.
- Added DISTANCEYELL, DISTANCETALK, DISTANCEWHISPER to sphere.ini - a value of -1 turns it into a
  broadcast.

13-01-2004, Kell
- The @Create trigger for items works as any other item trigger - it can be fully scripted.
  After a LOT of work, you can now also check for SRC under item's @Create. There are situations where
  an item can be created without an SRC, but in most cases, there will be one. Eg:
  ON = @Create
     if ( <SRC.UID> )
        SRC.SYSMESSAGE You have created an item!
     endif
  Bear in mind that @Create is created before the item by the server, so it can still suffer transformations
  after it's been created. Particulary, you won't be able to REMOVE an item under a @Create trigger - it
  will have no effect.
- Added ISEMPTY and ISNUM. Eg: <ISEMPTY <VAR.TMP>> or <ISNUM <VAR.TMP>>. 
- Added STATICS.FINDID.xxx - it will take you to the ITEMDEF of the static item with the supplied ID
- Added @ResourceTest to REGIONRESOURCE sections, called once for each resource in the region that the
  character is able to find.
- Added @ResourceFound, triggered after a resource has been selected (@ResourceTest has been called for
  all resources available). ARGO is the resource bit to be placed at the location. "return 1" keeps the
  resource bit, but sets it to be empty.
- Added DEFMESSAGE section for scripts, allows setting of strings to be used by the server. More will be
  added - work in progress. You now REQUIRE a script with these strings.
- Fixed RESOURCES.xxx.val and .key.

19-01-2004, Kell
- Fixed a bug with getting stuck on stuff.
- STR, DEX and INT are always equal to O + MOD (for the relevant stat). If you have OSTR=50, MODSTR=10 and
  then do STR=70, you will get OSTR=60 and MODSTR unchanged.

21-01-2004, Kell
- Changed max height difference on CanSeeLOS from PLAYER_HEIGHT/2 to PLAYER_HEIGHT, so that you can access
  chests on top of a table.
- Removed the password being shown on console when a password error occurs.
- Made .x* and .set* commands respect PLEVEL. You also need plevel to use the "SET" command to use .x and .set
  commands.
- Slightly smarter NPCs against field spells - they will avoid them more often depending on INT.
- Fixed another spot where SRC was undefined in @Create (there might still be more of these).

23-01-2004, Kell
- Fixed buying multiple pets from animal trainers.
- Fixed a bug in FOR where counting down wouldn't work (eg: FOR 10 1 works now)

24-01-2004, Kell
- Fixed bug with NPCs going stale (their timer going -1) - particulary pets.
- Fixed @Effect in SPELL sections to work and have same arguments as @SpellEffect.
- Added SPELLFLAG_SCRIPTED (010000) so that one can more easily override the default behaviour of
  spells.

25-01-2004, Kell
- Fixed yet another exploit, with sending a hacked Author in books (tks Balkon)
- Added PROMPT_MSG to SPELL sections and disabled the hard-coded messages. You'll have to fill in the
  prompt messages for the spells.

---- 0.55 R3 rc3 --------------------------------------------------------------
---- 06/02/2004

25-01-2004, Kell
- Fixed a bug with @Gain trigger, that regardless of it even existing would reset the skill to the skill
  being tested. This turned out in Parrying skill interrupting combat, and other buggy skill behaviour.
- Added EF_Scripts_Parse_Verbs (040). If enabled, verbs (the 1st command in a script line) are parsed
  before execution, thus making "TRY" obsolete for that purpose. Example:
     LOCAL.MYSTAT = MODSTR
     // the following line is parsed to become: str = <<local.mystat>> + 5
     <LOCAL.MYSTAT> = <<LOCAL.MYSTAT>> + 5
     SYSMESSAGE Stat '<LOCAL.MYSTAT>' increased to <<LOCAL.MYSTAT>>.

26-01-2004, Kell
- Renamed SPELLFLAG_TARG_OBJ to SPELLFLAG_TARG_ITEM. This is really an internal change, but you should
  change spheredefs.scp to be:
  SPELLFLAG_TARG_ITEM 000002
  SPELLFLAG_TARG_CHAR 000004
  SPELLFLAG_TARG_OBJ  SPELLFLAG_TARG_CHAR | SPELLFLAG_TARG_ITEM
- Made sure a character can only be targeted by a spell with SPELLFLAG_TARG_CHAR, and that an item
  can only be targetted by a spell with SPELLFLAG_TARG_ITEM.
- Modified TARGET command to allow 3 possible suffixes (in this order): F, G and W. So you can do
  TARGETGW, TARGETFW, etc. 
  F - Call a function after target ( eg: TARGETF f_rename )
  W - Warn against criminal action
  G - Target ground
- Made sure flags in the CAN= field for ITEMDEFs work correctly. A few items are missing these flags,
  such as i_wall_stone_7 missing CAN_I_BLOCK (so NPCs walk through them).
- Added MULTICREATE command, so you can place multi items via scripts: first set their position then
  call MULTICREATE to build them permanently.

27-01-2004, Kell
- Added EF_New_Maps (020), which enables the mapchange packet (0bf, subcmd 08). If enabled, moving to
  mapplane 1 or 2 will send a packet for the client to see the appropriate map, and moving to other
  mapplanes will send the packet changing back to basic map. This allows one to see the new maps.
  However, there is NO support on the server for new maps. That means that you're walking on the new
  map only on the clientside, while on the server you're walking on the standard map.
- Server now recognizes bogus extended message 15 - won't send error message to client.
- Added recognition for clients up to 4.0.0c - will not endure AOS features though. Useful for people
  with plain AOS installation that wish to play on the server.
- Mind you that this isn't AOS support, it's merely supporting the client.

28-01-2004, Kell
- Fixed TARGP not being set when using a spell.
- Added SPELLFLAG_TARG_NOSELF (0800), which stops spells from being cast on the player itself.
- Fixed accessing LOCAL variables straight within DIALOG sections (also fixes FOR loops).
- "return 1" within a DIALOG section stops the dialog from actually being sent.

30-01-2004, Kell
- Changed SPELLEFFECT to take UID of SRC as 3rd argument, and UID of source item as 4th argument
  (optional). To maintain compatibility, a 3rd argument of '1' refers to the current SRC.
  Example: CONT.SPELLEFFECT s_fireball 1000 <CONT.UID>
  In this example, <cont.uid> will be the SRC of @Effect and @SpellEffect triggers. Say no to
  equip fudging :p
- Fixed KARMA going to odd ranges.
- Added EF_Intrinsic_Locals (080), so that after you do LOCAL.X = something, you can access it
  via just <X>. Be careful though, not to name local variables after some known keyword, or your
  results might how you want them. 
  Example:
      LOCAL.X = 10
      SYSMESSAGE X is <X>.

02-02-2004, Kell
- Fixed an exploit that would allow insta-resurrection anywhere (death menu packet).
- Fixed one last \n\r packet exploits.
- Made sure \n or \r are never saved to the world file, so even if some packet exploit got overlooked,
  it'll end up causing no harm and issue a warning in the console.. This is likely to be the end of
  99% of shard hacking.

03-02-2004, Kell
- Fixed FOR x being 0 based - FOR 5 will now loop from 1 to 5 and not from 0 to 5.
- Fixed "/" character in parsing of simple formulas (so you don't need to use eval when
  assigning formulas to TAGs/VARs or in RETURN).
- Fixed @Targon_ground in GM mode with weapons throwing critical exception (it was attempting
  to damage a static item, which obviously is not an item at all).
- Targon_ triggers now have argn1 as the id of the static item (if a static was targeted),
  and ARGO being the targeted item (reduntant yes, but coherent).
- (intermediary test release here to get some feedback)
- Polymorph spell fixed.

04-02-2004, Kell
- When loading a world with VERSION below "0.55 R3", convert spells that affect stats, by
  removing its effect from base stats (old method) then putting the effect into modstats
  (new method). This ensures compatibility with spells and cursed items.
  Notice that this only works for worlds saved on versions earlier than R3, seeing as worlds
  saved on the test versions of R3 made no conversion and thus had items with both formats
  which cannot be distinguished.
  If for some reason you want to bypass this conversion on an old world, change the version
  of the save files to "0.55 R3". If you want to force this conversion on a world saved with
  R3 test versions, change its version to "0.55".
- Fixed melee weapons with large RANGE hitting through walls.
- Added ARCHERYMAXDIST to sphere.ini (defaults to 12).
- RANGE works for ranged weapons (bows) too. If no minimum range is set, then ARCHERYMINDIST
  is used. If no maximum range is set, then ARCHERYMAXDIST is used.
  Notice that on ITEMDEFs, syntax for range is either RANGE=min,max or RANGE=max (assumes 0
  as min for melee weapons, or archerymindist for ranged weapons).
- Account delete should be working fine now.
- IPs now accept 255 as a wildcard. So if you add an ip under BLOCKIPs with:
  1.2.255.255 you will actually be blocking everyone IP under 1.2
- EOF Account really fixed now (thanks everyone who pointed all the flaws out).
  note for programmers: never ignore the return error value of a function :p
- Added <StrPos iPos, ch, string>, where iPos is the position to start at and ch can be
  either a single character, or the ascii code for a character.
  Example:  <strpos 0 32 Where is the first space> --> will return 5.
      <strpos 3 e  Where is the first 'e'> --> will return 4.
- Added <StrSub iPos, iCount, string>. Returns "iCount" numbers string, starting at iPos.
  Example:  <strsub 3 4 Oh look at this> --> will return "look".
- Both StrSub and StrPos can take a negative value as iPos. In such a case, the position 
  is counted from the end of the string. So if you do:
  StrSub -5 2 <abcdefg> --> returns "cd".
- Changed StrArg / StrEat to stop at either a space or a comma. These are quick functions
  when you just want to take one argument from a string, or just want the string after one
  argument. Imagine you have a function that takes 1 number and a string. Instead of using
  argv[], you could use strarg to get the number and streat to get the string.

05-02-2004, Kell
- Spells with SPELLFLAG_SCRIPTED can "return 0" in @Effect/@SpellEffect to bypass any
  hardcoded effect, w/o cancelling the spell.
- Duration for summon spells now takes in consideration the DURATION field in the SPELL section and
  the caster level (yeah, it didn't).
- @SpellEffect/@Effect is triggered on the NPC when it is first summoned (it's always considered to
  be the s_summon_creature spell, regardless of spell initially used to summon the NPC).

06-02-2004, Kell
- Spells with both SPELLFLAG_TARG_XYZ and SPELLFLAG_TARG_CHAR/ITEM can be used either on the ground
  or on a character / item.

---- 0.55 R3 final ------------------------------------------------------------
---- 31/05/2004
---- * unofficial release [unallowed]

07-02-2004, Kell
- Added FeaturesLogin= to sphere.ini, allows setting of the flags sent in the 0xA9 packet, on login.

08-02-2004, Kell
- Added EVENTS/TEVENTS to items. Order of triggering is as follows:
   1) If it's a character activating the trigger, check for triggers sensitive to items (@ItemDClick, etc).
   2) triggers in EVENTS on the item
   3) triggers in TEVENTS on the item
   4) triggers in TYPEDEF section for the corresponding TYPE of the item
   5) triggers in ITEMDEF section of the item
   6) default hardcoded behaviour (if any).
  a "return 1" in any case, stops further processing of triggers.

21-02-2004, Kell
- There is a feature/bug when checking to see wether a player has some specific items, any item of a similar
  type will do. It affects these items:
     0175d (cloth), 01067 (leather), 01078 (hides), 01bdd (log), 01bd7 (boards), 00f3f (arrow), 01bfb (bolt).
  e.g., when the server tries to find an arrow, any t_weapon_arrow will do, and so on.
  Added flag EF_Item_Strict_Comparison (0200) to disable this behaviour.
  
25-03-2004, Radiant
- Added some combat, server and command messages to sphere_msgs.scp.
- Added two file handleing commands:
   SERV.WRITEFILE <filename> <text>
   SERV.DELETEFILE <filename>
  Because these commands can be quite destructive, option flag OF_FileCommands (080) must be enabled 
  for these commands to work. Be careful, because any GM with access to SERV.* commands could use this!
  More will follow soon.
- Added @UserChatButton trigger (return 1 disables default (chat window) behaviour)
- Added @UserMailBag trigger (return 1 disables default (message) behaviour)
  NOTE: It seems this is also triggered on login, try using something like
    if (<uid> == <src.uid>)
      return 1
    endif
  to prevent this.

26-03-2004, Radiant
- Added <READFILE filename line> statement
  If line == 0 this will return the last line of the file, if line == -1 this will return the first line of
  the file. This needs OF_FileCommands (080) to be enabled because of obvious security reasons.
  This will return "" (nothing) on failure.
- Added <FILELINES filename> statement, returns the amount of lines in a file.
  If this is 0 it means the file doesnt exist or cannot be read. This too needs OF_FileCommands (080).
- Added some error and misc. messages to sphere_msgs.scp.
- Added SYSMESSAGEUA (syntax equal to SAYUA).
  *** NOTE *** People using Taran's colored sysmessage script will experience problems! Remove Taran's script
  and change your scripts to use the hardcoded function instead (which is much faster and efficient anyway).
- Fixed missing return char in TRY console errors and added the UID of the object causing the error.
- Added @Attack trigger (after someone doubleclicked a character to attack).
  SRC is the target. "return 1" will cancel the attack.
- Added @UserWarmode trigger, fired when a user hits the warmode button before sphere changes the warmode flag.
  ARGN is the current warmode state (1 = in warmode, 0 = peace). "return 1" cancels the warmode change.

27-03-2004, Radiant
- Got sphere to compile on FreeBSD, it's not very stable yet, working on that (problem with signal handlers).
- Added TRYSRC <uid> <verb>, executes <verb> with <uid> as the SRC. Death to equip fudging!
  Note that the default object is the object this is called on, so link.trysrc <cont.uid> will make <link> the
  default object and <cont> the <src>. Very useful in timers!

28-03-2004, Radiant
- Disabled SENDPACKET S"" and put in a little notice that you should use <ASC> instead.
- Casting recall/gate travel on an item now fires @SpellEffect on that item.

31-03-2004, Radiant
- Added OF_NoItemNaming (0100), prevents sphere from naming items "sword crafted by Player"
- Added EF_No_Pause_Packet (0400), this prevents sphere from sending a Disable Redraw (or pause) packet everytime
  a new item/character is sent to the client. This is a bandwidth saver and lag preventer.
  This saves about 45 bytes for each action, this doesn't seem much but you can notice the difference.

02-04-2004, Radiant
- Changed skillsum to DWORD, which fixes the problem with high skillsums not working.

04-04-2004, Radiant
- Gate travel spell now LINKs the gate to the person that opened it.

06-04-2004, Radiant
- Healing is now interrupted properly when hit, fixes exception problem.

08-04-2004, Radiant
- Fixed signal locking problem on Linux/FreeBSD, running sphere in multi-threading mode still has problems, I'll look
  at that tomorrow. Sphere now survives pretty much every error on Linux/FreeBSD (only tested on FreeBSD), as long as
  it's running in single thread mode.

09-04-2004, Radiant
- Threading problem seems to be a little more complicated, but at least sphere runs very stable for me without threading
  on FreeBSD. I've tried it on Slackware, which still had alot of problems. I'll leave that for Kell ;)

11-04-2004, Balkon
- Fixed bug when pick up few items from a pile on the ground it's timers become -1
- Added @Pickup_Self - fired on container when item picked up from it, ARGO points to item we picking up
  @ItemPickup_Self for chars, ACT - container , ARGO - item we picking up
  Removed Reveal() from corpse looting - one can do it using @Pickup_Self if needed
- @Dropon_Char, @ItemDropon_Char now called when drop an item directly on charater either (before secure trade window 
  shown and @NPCAccept/Refuseitem triggers), ARGO points to character we drop the item on, or character's backpack

11-04-2004, Balkon
- Can't provoce char against an item
- Return 1 in @Login fixed (character will not stay in the world, no "client version check" loop)
- Fixed CONT and TOPOBJ in @EquipTest, item not moved if can't be equipped when doubleclick on it

12-04-2004, Radiant
- Added LOCALLIGHT property on characters, if this is 0 the normal lightlevel (sector) will be used, if this is higher the
  LOCALLIGHT value will be sent as lightlevel instead. You will need to use UPDATE after you have changed this, because the
  light level is not automatically updated. This overrides nightsight.
  (note: if you want to give a character a LOCALLIGHT level of 0, just set the nightsight flag)

13-04-2004, Balkon
- OF_NoHouseMuteSpeech (0200) - if enabled players are able to hear each other inside and outside the house
- Started remaking a CanSeeLos and CanWalk, temporary added EF_CanSeeLos_New (0800) to enable both changes
  as for now it fixes shoot through walls an fall through the floor in house regions interception area bugs, 
  more changes here later...

14-04-2004, Radiant
- @DClick is now triggered before the item is attempted to be equipped

15-04-2004, Balkon
- EF_WalkCheck (01000) - new walk check code, should fix lot of house looting bugs (patched verdata, walk under stairs etc.)
  NOTE: in default script pack some stairs are in DUPELIST of items, which are not really a stairs, so they have
  wrong CAN flags (CAN_I_CLIMB is not set). Make sure you've fixed your scripts before enabling this EF or you'll 
  not be able to walk on some of dynamic stairs

16-04-2004, Balkon
- some optimization to EF_WalkCheck, fixing climb height after teleporting and Z changing
- fixed bug when summoned NPC's have loot
- fixed RESOURCES.1 returned string in RESMAKE format
- fixed shafts etc. dupe bug

17-04-2004, Radiant
- Started working on some basic AOS functionality, EF_AgeOfShadows (02000) will enable this.
  Currently only enables tooltips (which aren't even working for now). Don't forget to enable flag 020 in FeaturesLogin!
- Fixed a nasty exploit that would allow anyone to crash sphere and/or execute code on your machine without even logging in
  (thanks Furio for reporting this)
- Fixed AOS Tooltips, now only shows the name for items and characters. I'll add other things later.
- Added AOS/LBR fading damage counter thing (requires EF_AgeOfShadows). This only shows for you and the person that hit you,
  I believe thats how it works on OSI (or doesn't it?). Showing it for everyone would make it laggy in my opinion.

17-04-2004, Balkon
- torch/candle dupe bug seems to be fixed at last :)

18-04-2004, Balkon
- fixed ACCOUNT properties was not accessable for logged out chars
- added ISPLAYER function - just a little feature :)
- added ISONLINE function - for players returns 1 if client is online (connected) and 0 overwise, for NPCs returns 1 when 
  NPC is in the world or 0 if it is offline (shrinked, mounted pets)
- added NOTOGETFLAG function, returns notoriety flags for specified char, syntax: NOTOGETFLAG Viewer_Serial,Allow_Incognito
  returned values:
  NOTO_GOOD   1 // good(blue)
  NOTO_GUILD_SAME   2 // same guild
  NOTO_NEUTRAL  3 // Neutral
  NOTO_CRIMINAL 4 // criminal
  NOTO_GUILD_WAR  5 // Waring guilds
  NOTO_EVIL   6 // evil(red)
  if no args specified returns flags for SRC as a viewer, NOTOGETFLAG 0,1 will return flags for SRC as a viewer with 
  Allow_Incognito = true
  NOTE: for red guildmates it will return NOTO_EVIL, not NOTO_GUILD_SAME

18-04-2004, Radiant
- Some additions to AOS tooltips

19-04-2004, Kell
- A few changes to AOS tooltips for cross-platform compatibility (itoa).

19-04-2004, Radiant
- Fixed status updates not sending with EF_No_Pause_Packet flag set
- Made @userStats fire on every status update that is being sent, if ARGN3 == 1 then the user has just opened the status window
- More tooltips stuff, type specific
- Added AOS/LBR Popup Menu's, these can be activated by setting flag 08 in FeaturesLogin (currently only for characters).

19-04-2004, Balkon
- RANGE bug fixed
- updating last regen time for dead chars so that they will not get ticks every tenth of second any more

20-04-2004, Balkon
- some traffic optimization:
  short stats change packets now used instead of full status packet when changing only hits/mana/stamina or it's max. values
  HITSUPDATERATE in sphere.ini controls how often (in seconds) my changed hits will be sent to others who can see me,
  default value is 1, incraise to reduce the traffic usage, 0 value disables sending such updates (like it was on 55i)
- MAXHITS etc. fixed. .MAXHITS 100 will now set MAXHITS to 100, this will include MODSTR so that if you had MODSTR 10 before 
  setting MAXHITS than when you change MODSTR back to 0 MAXHITS will be 90.
- maxhits displayed for others changed from 25 to 50 for smoother hits line changing on the statusbar

21-04-2004, Radiant
- Added MESSAGEUA, syntax equal to SAYUA and SYSMESSAGEUA
- Fixed lack of argument checking in SAYUA that sometimes causes an exception
- Added support for the "Virtue button" (at the top of the paperdoll on newer clients), fires the @UserVirtue trigger.
- Added support for the new spellbook packets (old ones don't work with AOS), if EF_AgeOfShadows is not set the old packets will
  be used (this is for Magery, there is no Necromancy or Paladin stuff (yet)).

22-04-2004, Radiant
- Re-added the "The spell fizzles" message on spell failure

22-04-2004, Balkon
- setting values in quotas for TAGs, VARs and LOCALs now will create text tags, i.e. 
  TAG.TEST_1 2+2
  will create numrecal tag TEST_1 with value 04, but
  TAG.TEST_2 "2+2"
  will create text tag with text '2+2'.
  Text tags and vars are saved quoted also.
- fixed REGION.TAG0.SOMETHING caused 'Undefined symbol "" error' when tag SOMETHING is not set

23-04-2004, Radiant
- Found out that new spellbook packets are broken, still not fixed
- Added support for necro book spells, now reads the spelldefs for these (101 - 116), will add hardcoded behaviour later
- Added @UserExWalkLimit trigger, fired if a user exceeds the Walk limit (is either lagging alot or speedhacking)
  RETURN 1 allows the user to walk, no action or RETURN 0 disallows the user to walk
  (note: this is pretty expensive because it's fired each time a step is taken while the user's walkbuffer is at 0, so be careful)

24-04-2004, Radiant
- Removed message from WEBLINK command
- Fixed .admin showing japanese text/crashing client with long character names (names are truncated to 30 chars)
- SERV.NEWDUPE and DUPE now sets NEW (and ACT? coded but not tested) for items only, duping chars doesn't work like it should yet
- DCLICK/USE on characters now takes an argument (uid), makes the character DCLICK a certain item/char
- CALL function is no longer case-sensitive
- Added arguments to dialogs, in this form: "DIALOG d_dlg 0 blabla", both <args> and <argv[x]> can be used. <argn> is the page number
  (second argument)

25-04-2004, Radiant
- Added COMMANDLOG option in sphere.ini, only logs commands issued by this plevel and higher. (default = 0, log all)

29-04-2004, Balkon
- after some beta testing few fixes in equip and EF_WalkCheck
- added EVENTSPET to sphere.ini - events far all NPCs
- added EF_DiagonalLOSCheck (04000) - to see the object in diagonal direction we must be able to see the point at least 
  in one of ortogonal directions, this mean you can't see objects only through the "corner", this fixes teleport through
  fence NW corner and some other bugs but still allows, for example, closing doors which are in diagonal direction 
  to you when opened :) Setting this flag may incraise CPU usage.
- alternative name in TAG.NAME.ALT is now used everywhere if tag is set - in character status, corpse names, linked 
  memories etc. It overrides incognito name also. The real name is only accessable via NAME property.
  TAG.NAME.PREFIX now overrides fame prefixes (shown on click). TAG.NAME.PREFIX and TAG.NAME.SUFFIX are now can be combined
  with TAG.NAME.ALT

01-05-2004, Balkon
- fixed bug when closing dialog with targeting cursor up canceled targeting
- removed \r check from character profile packet - this allows to have a multiline profile and fixing wrong "Cheater" warnings
- fixed bug when players was able to buy any items from vendor even outside the stock (equipped on him. in his backpack etc.)
- vendor now will simply transfer items to character's backpack if they are stored in his "extras" box or if he is a player's 
  vendor (they was duped, you bought the copy and the old one deleted before). Shrinked pets will not be unshrinked when sold
  from player's vendor (or from extras box).

02-05-2004, Balkon
- EF_CanSeeLos_New is not longer used, all fixes affected by this EF are now included to the code by default.

03-05-2004, Socket (UNSP team)
- Started work on fullfeatured guild/town system. Added MEMBER property to guildstones. You shall use it this way:
  <guildstone>.member.X.<property> These properties are available for read/write: ACCOUNTGOLD, LOYALTO, PRIV,
  SHOWABBREV, GUILDTITLE. Functions available: IsCandidate (returns 1 if member is a recruit), IsMember (1 if member),
  IsMaster (returns 1 if guildmaster). Also, MEMBER.X. construction points directly to character, so you
  could use something like MEMBER.X.NAME in your scripts. MEMBER.COUNT returns total number of guildmembers.
- ACCOUNTGOLD guild member's property is now saving to worldsave too.
- Added new GOLDRESERVE property to guildstone.
- Added new <CONT>.COUNT function which returns a total amount of items in the container.
- Added new SERV.CLIENT.x reference. SERV.CLIENT.0. is a newest client and so on, for example <serv.client.0.name>
  will return the name of last logged in client. Reference is READ-ONLY for safety. In this case you could save
  client uid somewhere and work with his using UID.<uid>. reference.

07-05-2004, Socket
- <CONT>.COUNT now returns an amount of items only in selected container, without counting items in containers inside it.
- Added <CONT>.FCOUNT function, which returns a TOTAL amount of items inside container.

11-05-2004, Balkon
- some fixes, @EquipTest now fired before all internal checks, before item unstacked from the pile, before item in same layer
  unequipped (this mean if you have return 1 there char will not unequip previews item)

16-05-2004, Balkon
- fixed @Dropon_char called when dropping item to any container on the char. Now it called only when you really drop the item
  on the character - directly on his head or on his backpack if you don't own him. ARGO now always points to character.

19-05-2004, Balkon
- fixed @color,font in MESSAGE and SYSMESSAGE, now it accept hexadecimal values, added 3-rd argument there - unicode flag, 
  new format is SYSMESSAGE @color,font,unicode text, added @color,font,unicode to SAY and broadcast either. Of course SAYUA,
  MESSAGEUA and SYSMESSAGEUA still can be used for this, but @color,font,unicode is accepted in default messages definition
  (sphere_msgs.scp), so now we can have default messages in unicode :)
- added OF_SkipUndefMsgs (0400) - if flag is set sphere don't send error strings for undefined default messages, 
  dont print errors on resync - just ignores it, so now we can disable some default messages if needed.
- SPEED wepaons property now used in fight delay calcilation if set (and not 0), the formula is 
  DELAY = 15000 / ( ( DEX +100 ) * SPEED )

20-05-2004, Balkon
- some optimization in hit messages (get only messages which really will be sent to client)
- added SPEEDSCALEFACTOR to INI (defaul value is 15000), used in weapon delay calcultions, now formula looks like
  DELAY = SPEEDSCALEFACTOR / ( ( DEX + 100 ) * SPEED )
- ARGN1 in @HitTry now is the delay (in tenths of second) left before the hit, can be changed

21-05-2004. Balkon
- added FORCLIENTS and FORPLAYERS loops, difference is that FORPLAYERS will loop through disconnected players which are 
  still stay in the world (client linger) either.
- if no args specifiead for FORITEMS, FORCHARS, FOROBJS, FORCLIENTS, and FORPLAYERS loops value 18 is used by default 
  (maximum view distance)
- added FORCONTID and FORCONTTYPE loops, format is FORCONTID i_dagger max_sub_containers. If max_sub_containers is not 
  present it will search in all subcontainers. If max_sub_containers = 0 - it will search only in this container.
- added FORCHARLAYER layer - loop through all objects in specified layer
- added FORCHARMEMORYTYPE flags - loop through all memory objects with this flags

25-05-2004. Balkon
- fixed bug when after parsing quoted lines when setting VARs, TAGs and LOCALs didn't create text variables

27-05-2004, Socket
- Fixed guild MEMBER.X.KEY for read/write. Now it should be working well. Will return error if you try
  to access non-existant member (so it should be better to use MEMBER.COUNT to check bounds).

---- 0.55 R4.0.1 --------------------------------------------------------------
---- 07/06/2004
---- * unofficial release [unallowed]

30-05-2004, Kell
- Little fixes to allow compile under Linux (use strcmpi() for caseless string
  comparison, and add casts to (LPCTSTR) on CGStrings).
- Changed version number. I suggest using R4.x.y where xx is increased when
  something major is done and yy is for little changes. Set to R4.0.1.
  (ps: some people never quite understood what RC* means. After the 20th it
   stops being a release candidate, it's more like a candidate to a release
   candidate. So after the "powers that be" have adopted and turned that
   numbering scheme into a mockery, I suggest we change to something less
   confusing.

31-05-2004, Furio
- Added FORCONT loop, format is FORCONT uid_of_container max_sub_containers. It
  will loop on every item present in the container. If max_sub_containers is not
  present it will search in all subcontainers. If max_sub_containers = 0 - it
  will search only in this container. (Thx to Balkon for the base code for
  container loops)

07-06-2004, Furio
- Made a blank REVISIONS.TXT because it was getting pretty big.
- Added XOR (^) operator to expressions.

---- 0.55 R4.0.2 --------------------------------------------------------------
---- 22/07/2004
---- * unofficial release [unallowed]

12-06-2004, Furio
- Added two new INI value USECRYPT and USENOCRYPT. The first if 0 don't allow at
  encrypted client to login otherwise allow them to log (default is 1). The
  second if 0 don't allow at unencrypted client to login otherwise
  if 1 -> allow and suppose that the clientversion is >= 2.0.0
  if 2 -> n/a
  if 3 -> allow and suppose that the clientversion is >= 3.0.0
- Added the most requested security-by-obscurity feature DISGUISEVERSION in
  sphere.ini. If set change the version outputted to clients, ircserver,
  webserver, listserver, telnetserver to its value otherwise the default build 
  value is used. (Mind that the version in savefile and in console startup is 
  the default build version)
- Fixed (i hope) bug with Mozilla/Firefox browser with the status page
- Fixed a buffer overrun bug that could be exploited to crash or run arbitrary
  code, in the log system.

20-06-2004, kuch
- Added ClearTags function (removes all the tags from the char/item/account);
  Revital did most of the work, but I get the credit.

28-06-2004, Furio
- Fixed multiple gump exploits. In order to do this now memory 08000 is used as
  internal memory (is called MEMORY_GUMPRECORD).
- Fixed and refined things for disguise version feature.

02-07-04, kuch
- Added MODMAXWEIGHT: allows you to increase/decrease max carrying capacity of a
  char.
- Added MODAR: allows you to increase/decrease the overall AR of a char
  NOTE: there are no oStat equivalents (ie oModAr or oModMaxWeight) for the
  above.
- Also added the following to avoid possible confusion:
  * MAXWEIGHT - same as WEIGHTMAX
  * AR - same as AC
  * MODAC - same as MODAR
  * MODWEIGHTMAX - same as MODMAXWEIGHT
  
03-07-04, kuch
- Added 135 more strings (mostly from skills) to sphere_msg.scp
- Added new .ini option: WOOLGROWTHTIME: how long in minutes it takes for wool
  on sheared sheep to regrow.
- Added new .ini option: SKILLPRACTICEMAX: how high can you train a skill on
  dummy/archery_target.

04-07-04, kuch
- Added 93 more strings: NPC speech and skill msgs; there are now 329 string 
  messages in sphere_msgs.scp.
- Added TAGCOUNT function (works on regions/items/chars/accounts) - returns the
  number of tags on that obj
- Fixed CLEARTAGS (now also works on regions)

06-07-04, kuch
- Fixed some weird bug in jobmage.scp and jobnoble.scp 
- Added a lot more strings to sphere_msgs.scp; If you find any bugs with them,
  kuchervano@hotmail.com me immediately!

07-07-04, Furio
- Fixed DISTANCEWHISPER not working correctly.

07-07-04, kuch
- Added DEFFOOD value to sphere_defs.scp - this is a template of items you want
  to get by casting the create food spell; Yes it does not give you a great deal
  of control over what you get (ie skillbased for example), but its better than
  nothing
  
09-07-04, Furio
- Fixed bug with ^ operator.

16-07-04, Vjaka
- Fixed bug with armor/weapon when hits were above to hitsmax.
- Cosmetic fix to report Client out overflow error line once per dialog instead
  of tons of them.
- Added trigger function f_onchar_delete triggered before client is going to
  delete a character. SRC is char, return 1 denyes deletion.
- Added trigger function f_onaccount_login triggered after client entered the
  password, ARGS is account name, return 1 disconnects.
- Added spell flag SPELLFLAG_PLAYERONLY 020000 which denies spell being cast by
  npc ai (no more npcs casting shrink if not wished to).

17-07-04, Vjaka
- Added @NPCLostTeleport to trigger before NPC is going to be teleported back to
  its spawn (by LostNPCTeleport sphere.ini setting), ARGN1 is the distance from
  the spawn.
- Added INI switch PAYFROMPACKONLY (default: 0). If set to 1, then buying stuff
  from vendors will search pack only for the gold.
- Added @Hunger to trigger before char is going to loss a food level. ARGN1 is
  the food level that will be set, return 1 cancels.

19-07-04, Vjaka
- Removed IRC server from default build settings. It is buggy, has holes inside 
  and probably should not used by anyone.
- Reverted memory information profiling in Win32 version (stability testings).
- Fixed NoMessages and Quick login mode (ARNG1/2 in @Login) now skips sphere
  version information and Welcome back.. prompt.
- Fixed some exceptions for ticking events. Some division by zero removed, and
  the exceptions are made less critical (actualy the way they should be - quite
  local). It means that the server should be more stable now. Also they gives
  usualy more information on when the error occured.
- Added @StepStealth triggering on each step made by person in stealth. ARGN1
  (in and out) - whatever to reveal him or not.
- Added isnumber(something) - returns 1 if it is a number (only number of radix
  10 suits). Useful in argtxt validation.

19-07-04, Furio
- Fixed compatibility issues with Linux for isnumber(something).
- Added TAG.DIALOG_NAME to MEMORY_GUMPRECORD. The tag contains the name of the 
  dialog opened. Special case are the .admin gump (clientlist), the hair dye
  gump (hairdye), a guild hardcoded gump (guild) and if no name is found
  (undef). Hope that this will help in checking what gumps are opened on client
  screen.
- Added SDIALOG command. It works like DIALOG with the difference that it'll
  open a dialog only if it's not present on the client screen.
- Fixed a thing in DISGUISEVERSION. Now .[x]show version shows the disguised
  version.

20-07-04, Vjaka
- Fixed compatibility issues with Unix for exceptions
- Added MODAR (MODAC) working on items as well. Now it is for both items and
  chars.
- Fixed startup sequence - now tryes to bind a socket before loading the world
  saving time on running multiply instances.
- Fixed Windows version buffered output flushing. Also removed log file
  buffering.

21-07-04, Kell
- Fixed some compilation issues under Linux (just missing some (DWORD) casts).

22-07-04, Furio
- If PAYFROMPACKONLY (default: 0). is enabled, in the char status only gold from
  pack is displayed.
- Fixed minor things on default messages.

22-07-04, Vjaka
- Added server state functions f_onserver_save, f_onserver_save_ok and
  f_onserver_save_fail. Arguments are ARGN1 - force save? and ARGN2 - save stage
  (for background saves). For f_onserver_save the ARGN1 is writeable and return
  1 cancels the save.
  Please note, that if background saves are enabled, these functions will be run
  tons of times during the worldsave process (at least 6144 [sectors amount]
  times).
- Added f_onserver_start function triggered server start.
- Created knownbugs.txt file to be distributed with sphere revisions.

---- 0.55 R4.0.3 --------------------------------------------------------------
---- * not released
---- * unofficial release [unallowed]

23-07-04, Vjaka
- Added some more exceptions debugging. It is going deeper and deeper to engine.
- Added MAXITEMCOMPLEXITY (default: 25) - the amount of items in one tile so
  start showing "too many items here".
- Added MAXSECTORCOMPLEXITY (default: 1024) - the amount of items in one sector
  to start showing "x items too complex".

24-07-04, Vjaka
- Removed instant logout in guarded areas. use REGION_FLAG_INSTA_LOGOUT instead 
  if you wish instant logout.
- Added console commands history of 5 latest commands in Windows version. You 
  can scroll them using UP key.
- Added one minute delay after take of an item from trade window before 
  accepting the deal.

25-07-04, Vjaka
- Added smsg/smsgu shortcuts for sysmessage/sysmessageua (note, that msg already
  existed as a shortcut to message)
- Added SKILLCLASS properties - if written like SRC.SKILLCLASS.NAME, returns 
  <SERV.SKILLCLASS.<SRC.SKILLCLASS>.NAME>
- Started doing ARGVCOUNT and realised that <ARGV> is the amount of ARGV[x] 
  variables. Noting that as not found in revisions.
- If player speech longer 5 chars and has 75% capital letters inside, it will 
  come out in lower case. Works for english chars only. And as for unicode - if
  EF_UNICODE is set.
- Added GUILD properties: <SRC.GUILD> returns 0 or guildstone UID,
  <SRC.GUILD.NAME> returns guild name
- Removed all old PLOT bit stuff. Use EVENTS instead
- Changed CLEARTAGS - it takes optional argument, clearing tags only if matching
  the string (does not support wildcards)
- Added HITS and MAXHITS to items (same as MORE1L and MORE1H). Note: this is
  valid for armor and weapon object.
- Telnet has a username. So, Administrator or RemoteAdmin login left for local 
  logins (127.0.0.1) if LOCALIPADMIN enabled

25-07-04, Furio
- Hopefully tracked down and fixed the arrow bug, and similar problem derived 
  from NEW (big thx to Handred that finded the point where start looking at for
  the fix).

26-07-04, Vjaka
- Fixed broken TEVENTS read method on chars.
- Added QVAL(test1,test2,res1,res2,res3) in addition to current <QVAL?:>
  variant. It is useful if dealing with numbers without many IF-s. Sample 
  <eval qval(<VAR.X>,<VAR.Y>,<VAR.ONE>,<VAR.TWO>,<VAR.THREE>)> will return
  <VAR.ONE> if <VAR.X> < <VAR.Y>, <VAR.TWO> if they are equal, and <VAR.THREE>
  if the it is greater. If some of the arguments are omited like qval(1,2,,3) it
  will default to zero.
- Changed REGISTERSERVER to default an empty string. If you wish to register to
  list.sphereserver.net, specify REGISTERSERVER=1 or it's host.
- Added TELEPORTEFFECTSTAFF, TELEPORTEFFECTPLAYERS, the teleport effect for
  staff (use hex id of object or 0 here) (default: 03709 for staff, 0372a for
  players).

27-07-04, Furio
- Fixed an issue with MOVE/XMOVE command.

27-07-04, Vjaka
- Added command line switch -Gpath/to/saves/ to defrag sphere server UIDs. It
  is done because sphere UID management routines has flows which makes not to
  reuse empty uids, but generate new, higher. Howewer, space for lower unused
  objects is still reserved. It saved 400Mb me (from 600Mb on start to 180Mb)
  working for 2.5 hours, but caused all mounts to disappear, maybe some more
  flaws. So, use on your own risk. In future versions for 4.0.x Furio is going
  to improve the uid subsystem and this will not be needed anymore.

28-07-04, Vjaka
- Changed FILELINES to close the file and READFILE if line number is too big.
- Added DISMOUNT verb on char to dismount him, MOUNT to get UID of ridden one.
- Fixed an issue with SERV.CLIENT.x. causing exceptions.
- Removed 0.55R from version. It is a complicated notation. It's 4.0.x now.
- Fixed MODAR not updating armor class if changed on char or equipped item.

29-07-04, Vjaka
- Limited allshow to MAXCHARCOMPLEXITY*4.
- Fixed issue when telnet connection could not do resync load after pausing.
- Account now has TAG.LastLogged with his previous login date. It is shown upon
  login if quick/no-messages login not selected (by @Login trigger).
- Fixed msg_criminal to be shown only if person is not a criminal yet (lags).
- Added read-only COMP reference for multis. Returns amount of components when
  called with no params, and has attributes: ID,D,DX,DY,DZ (D mean delta).
- NPC wishes gold and vendable items (not limited to desires listing).
- Added ARGN2 to @NPCLookAtItem (writeable) - the percent level the the NPC
  wish this item. If set high, he can loot the item.
- Added GMPAGES and GMPAGE.* verb to access gm pages from scripts. You can
  give arguments like you do to .page command, and use 2 specials - DELETE to
  delete even not-taken one, and HANDLE [uid] to mark gmpage for character.
  Also GMPAGE.x.HANDLED field returns UID of person taken the gmpage.

30-07-2004, Kell
- Added ACCOUNT.NAME

30-07-04, Vjaka
- Speed optimisation working with strings & possible some stack overflow out.

31-07-04, Vjaka
- Fixed several spells (like mark) casting in not allowed region when running.
- Fixed KILLS removal using multi-uo client.
- Changed @Logoff to take 2 writeable arguments: ARGN1 - linger time and ARGN2
  instant logoff flag. Return 1 in logoff is now obsolete.

01-08-04, Vjaka
- Added triggers @MurderDecay (ARGN1 - murder count that will be set, ARGN2 -
  decay time to set for the next kill) and @MurderMark (ARGN1 - murder count
  that will be set, ARGN2 - set criminal flag?). The names are descriptive.
- NPC is now trying to move objects blocking his walkpath. He also investigate
  the possibility to loot this item in several cases. Triggers look@item not
  called since if there are tons of items in the spot, it will be very laggy.
- Added @Rename trigger (ARGS - new name, ARGO - target char) when renaming a
  pet. Return 1 cancels. Also triggered when creating character.
- Items with ATTR_STATIC are now saved to spherestatics.scp and NOT SAVED by
  standart world save. So, you need to call .serv.savestatics to save them.
- NPC is now trying to cast good spells as on self and his combat friends also.

02-08-04, Vjaka
- Calling guards are now more speed optimised.
- Defrag mode now supports spherestatics.scp and is much faster.
- Changed FACE and SALUTE to take an optional argument - target object.
- Characters on the way do not disallow GM to place a house anymore.
- Items gets stacked one on the other witheen some height if possible.

03-08-04, Vjaka
- Exceptions catching fixed, some stack information added.
- Added CLEARVARS being same as CLEARTAGS.
- Fixed CLEARTAGS to work normal without arguments.
- Now VENDORMARKUP is taken from region tags if not found on a vendor.

04-08-04, Vjaka
- Default messages working optimised for speed. Removed OF_SkipUndefMsgs.
- Removed OF_Skill_DiffFirst since the actdiff is calculated in any case.
- Started implementing EF_Pathfinding.

05-08-04, Vjaka
- Fixed SERV.ITEMDEF reference to object not being currently in the world.

06-08-04, Vjaka
- Added SERV.resync to resync scripts without the resync delay.
- Now adding a new account automaticaly fills (FIRST/LAST)CONNECTDATE.
- Added @SkillMenu to trigger BEFORE calling any hardcoded skillmenu. So, you
  can return 1 to cancel the action. ARGS - the name of the menu, is one of:
  sm_polymorph, sm_carpentry, sm_bowcraft, sm_tailor_leather, sm_tailor_cloth,
  sm_bolts, sm_carpentry, sm_cartography, sm_tinker, sm_summon, sm_blacksmith,
  sm_alchemy, sm_cartography, sm_inscription.

07-08-04, kuch
- Finished the conversions of default messages into the new format: this should
  greately improve the execution speed.  Also updated sphere_msg.scp to fit new
  format.  Read the comments inside the file to get more more infomation.

09-08-04, Vjaka
- Added DISGUISENAME to alter the name of the server.
- Added REPLYPEERCONNECTS (default 1) to allow masterserver and peer connects.
- Fixed duplicating hungry messages search.

10-08-04, Vjaka
- Fixed NPC moving some items not actualy blocking their way.

11-08-04, Vjaka
- Added console commands auto-completion on using TAB key. File sphere.dic is
  read for the list of definitions. Note: this file SHOULD BE sorted (at least
  witheen each separate first letter) to multi-matches to work correctly.

12-08-04, Vjaka
- Added @ItemCreate triggered when an item (ARGO) is created by a client.
- Added auto-completion to telnet connection. The difference from winconsole is
  that it fills the word up to end ONLY if there is exact 1 variant, or if
  other variants contains this one in self.

13-08-04, Vjaka
- Optimised sysmessages - now nothing is sent to client if the message is empty.
  This is useful to clear default messages. If wish to scroll line, use space.
- Fixed exploit to crash clients by renaming pet with some special color. Thanks
  TheLegbra reporting that.

15-08-04, Vjaka
- Added EF_Script_Profiler (08000) to add information on functions usage for
  weak places (functions or triggers) to be optimised.
- Added EF_Size_Optimise (010000) to save WORLDITEM/CHAR/SCRIPT as W*. This is
  not much for now, saving 7+ bytes per object. Loading supports any method.

03-09-04, Vjaka
- Added OverSkillMultiply (default 2). When player skills/stats goes this times
  more than skillclass allowed, drop them to skillclass level. Setting this to
  0 disables the action.
- Added ACCOUNTS BLOCKED/JAILED arguments. Works exactly like UNUSED, but just
  applyes to the blocked/jailed accounts only.
- Only chars in mapplane where the player is are ticked now (lag reduction).

04-09-04, Vjaka
- Added ## command to console to save both world and statics.
- Added X# command to instant shutdown the server with world/statics save.
- Changed "commands uid=... (name) to ''" to show amount if above of 1.
- Server startup crash fixed

08-09-04, Furio
- Fixed issues for the Linux build.
- Disabled information abou "Key" on OnTriggerRun exception for compatibility 
  problem on the *Nix build. (temporary solution)
- Added .pid file (sphere.pid) on *Nix build, for those who want to write bash
  script for checking sphere process easily.

08-09-04, Vjaka
- EF_Pathinding is working perfectly making NPC to select a best path. Howewer,
  for maximal speed it is yet checking only static objects blocking his path.
  More testings on the speed needed before making it to include dynamics checks.
- Fixed Counselors losing their invis status after worldsave.

10-09-04, Vjaka
- Memory information is now got from system routines instead of internal one. It
  will cause this info to appear in UNIX builds, howewer, it will be not be in
  WINDOWS systems where PSAPI.DLL is not available (fe: Windows 95/98/NT4.0).
  Also this makes ALLOCS useless, since there is no way to get it.
- Added CLIENTS property for sectors and regions to get active clients count.

11-09-04, Vjaka
- Added EF_Clients_Thread (020000) to split clients handling to to other thread.
  This will work only in windows build and is not recommendable to change on fly.
  This is VERY experimental yet, since sphere is very singlethreaded by design.

13-09-04, Furio
- Fixed memory information on Unix. Now it uses two different methods to get
  memory information depending on *Nix system where sphere is running.

13-09-04, Vjaka
- Fixed functions profiler to strip off arguments of a function.
- Fixed console commands like ##, x# showing unknown keyword error in console.
- Fixed murder count set always to 1 by @MurderMark.

14-09-04, Vjaka
- Fixed LOCALs in f_onserver_start/f_onchar_delete.

18-09-04, Vjaka
- Code cleanups, removed some useless (not enabled keywords), same keywords grouped
  to one variant for usage for faster work lookups:
  1. *WEIGHT[MAX]->*[MAX]WEIGHT, BRAIN->NPC, KNOWLEDGE->SPEECH, COMMENT->TAG.COMMENT
  CLI*VER*->CLIENTVERSION, DEF->ARMOR, LISTEN->HEARALL, *PRICE->PRICE, VER->VERSION
  WEBPAGEDST->WEPAGEFILE (LoadKeys)
  2. CLIENTS->ALLCLIENTS, PARDON->FORGIVE, INVISIBLE->INVIS, INVULNERABLE->INVUL,
  R->RUN, W->WALK, CLIENTS->ADMIN, MIDI/MUSIC->MIDILIST, [RE]SYNC->RESEND, ADDITEM->ADD
  FOLLOWED->FOLLOW, M->MOVE, PROPS/TWEAK->INFO, SPEAK[U[A]]->SAY[U[A]], SFX->SOUND
  SAFE->SECURE (VerbKeys)

20-09-04, Vjaka
- Fixed errors on load if setting VERSION for saves to start from litera.
- Fixed paths in resource testing commands.
- Added EF_Minimize_Triggers (040000) to call as little triggers as needed by a minimum.
- Removed some declared but unused triggers.

23-09-04, Vjaka
- Removed unused EF_Allow_Override (it was not working anyway).
- Added OF_Advanced_AI (including moving objects in the path, helping friends by magic,
  pathfinding)
- Renamed EF_Client_Thread to OF_Multithreaded (0400)
- sphere.pid file is now created in Windows builds as well.

25-09-04, Vjaka 
- Removed ADDNPC since it is already integrated with ADD command for both items and npc.
- Removed some more duplicates (some really strange) to speed up lookups.
- Added showing of option flags on start.

26-09-04, Vjaka
- Removed different mail operations not working and other code cleanups.
- Bugfix: Disabled moving gold coins to vendor stock (items shifting).
- Bugfix: Disabled moving static/immovable items from ground, spell effect.
- Bugfix: Disabled gaining spell effect by ghost other than ressurection.
- Bugfix: Mounted creature will leave no corpse on death if died while mounted.
- Bugfix: @DeathCorpse is called only if corpse is really created.

27-09-04, Vjaka
- Added ISSTUCK keyword to check if npc can move to N/W/E/S dirs.

29-09-04, Vjaka
- Optimized OF_Advanced_AI, makes NPC to remember the path, recalculating it
  not so often (depending on INT).

30-09-04, Furio
- Added OF_Advanced_LOS (0800) this disable EF_CanSeeLOS and EF_DiagonalLOSCheck
  and enable a new method to check the LOS (still testing and optimizing).
- Fixed some compatibility problems with Linux build.
- Now Linux build is compiled statically, so no more tons of version linked to
  different shared library for each distro.

30-09-04, Vjaka
- Fixed Windows build issue.
- Removed EF_CanSeeLOS, EF_DiagonalLOSCheck, moved that to default LOS checks.
- Bugfix: unable to resurrect on too low strength. Now gets 1 HP at least.
- Average profile information is now saved to worldsaves and loaded.
- Option and Experimental flags are now shown in text on .show command.

03-10-04, Furio
- Optimized some parts in OF_Advanced_LOS.
- Fixed Linux build issue.
- Added ISTEVENT for chars (npc/players) working like ISEVENT 

04-10-04, Vjaka
- Regions now does not conflict if are in different mapplanes (useful for new
  maps support). You can also specify RECT=left,top,right,bottom,map in the
  rect record, specifyed the exact map for this rect to work.
- Started redoing the code to support multiple maps. This will invalidate old
  mapplane feature which was 0..255. This is affected mainly by teleports and
  moongates since many of default ones had 255 mapplain specifyed. You should
  change it to 0, since this is only for map0.
- Added MAP property same as MAPPLANE (in future MAPPLANE will be removed)
REVISIONS-56-SERIES

---- 0.56a --------------------------------------------------------------------
---- 08/12/2004

06-10-04, Vjaka
- Removed DISGUISE(NAME/VERSION), renamed the current version to 0.56a.

07-10-04, Vjaka
- Removed AGREE config line neccessaty since it is not longer R* series.
- Added startup expansion set support output depending on map*,statics*,staidx*
  files found and loaded (T2A, LBR, AOS, SE).
- Removed EF_New_Maps since it is integrated to source now, packet is sent when
  needed.
- Moving on other map now moves the same map on the server. But this currently
  does not use caching and re-read tile information from map files every time.
  Caching of same sectors but in different mapplanes will be in the future.
  You should both add regions for these maps, and place corresponding files in
  place where all other mul files resides.
- Changed values of EXPERIMENTAL flags to remove empty slots between items.

08-10-04, Vjaka
- Fixed memory leak caused by map cache removal.
- Fixed client screen update on map change.

08-10-04, Furio
- Added PROMPTCONSOLE, it makes the client prompt (like on page request) and send
  the response as an argument of a user definied function.
  (syntax PROMPTCONSOLE callback function, message to prompt)

10-10-04, Furio
- Added RESDISP properties to account. Accepted values are 0 (PreT2a client),
  1 (T2A), 2 (LBR), 3 (AoS), 4 (Samurai Empire). This is used to identify what type
  of client is logged in. As default is set at 0, but if the client is T2A is
  automatically set to 1 by Sphere. LBR, AoS and SE is not setted automatically and
  is leaved to you.
- Added to CHARDEF properties RESLEVEL, RESDISPDNID, RESDISPDNHUE. The first state
  from what UO version the anim comes. The second what anim id is showed to older
  client version. The third an hue showed to older client (if 0 or null the default
  anim hue is used.
- Modified scriptpack to reflect these changes for T2A monsters.

22-10-04, Vjaka
- Added <dVALUE> as a shortcut to <eval <VALUE>> to get a decimal value of a
  single expr like a variable. Note, this affects EF_Intrinsic_Locals a bit.
- Commands with .command and spaces before will be treated as without spaces,
  since extra space makes privileged chars to reveal self.
- Added TAG.PARTY_CANLOOTME for party. If 1, allows party to loot self.
- Added @Kill trigger (SRC-killer, ARGO-killed)
- Added sector function ALLCHARS,ALLITEMS similar to ALLCLIENTS. For regions
  you can use SECTORS.ALLCHARS, SECTORS.ALLITEMS.
- Changed GODPORT to accept port number as well. Old values ( <=0 = disables,
  1=ServPort+1000) are still working also.
- Added SYSCMD and SYSSPAWN commands to run external applications. Returns <0 if
  there was an error. The first one blocks while program is running while the
  second spawns and continues scripts execution. Due to obvious security fear
  in these commands, they are disabled if OF_FileCommands is not set. Up to 9
  command line arguments are passed to the external application.

23-10-04, Furio
- Fixed minor things in grayproto.
- Updated grayproto (list/sizes of Uo packet in Sphere).
- Finished and debugged the new crypt engine (for crypt clients). Currently up
  to latest current OSI client 4.0.5a is supported.

25-10-04, Vjaka
- Fixed exception in writefile when unable to open the file.
- Added account name output when packet dispatch generated an exception.

25-10-2004. Furio
- Still updated grayproto, with new packet infos.

26-10-04, Vjaka
- Fixed SMSG[u] resolve error.
- Fixed <dSOMEVAL> giving some hex results.
- Added update for items moved by NPCs when they blocks the path.

27-10-04, Vjaka
- Now Windows build tryes to use winsock 2.0 if available instead of 1.1.
- Added amount argument to NEWITEM (newitem i_gold,45). Defaults to 1.
- Removed one of occasions with creating an extra log not in logfile path.

27-10-04, Furio
- Fixed a bug in displaying big dialogs with newer clients (4.0.X).
- Fixed a bug where some clients were crashing when adding an item.

28-10-04, Vjaka
- Disabled string 'q'/'Q' to be said by privileged accounts. It is due the
  fact that default macro for repeat is Ctrl+Q, and one less Ctrl press will
  lead to GM to reveal self existance around, which really is not good.

31-10-04, Furio
- Some fixes related to account creation and bank/box hack.
- Removed EF_AgeOfShadows. It'll be re-added with new features and complete
  compatibility for older clients, when enabled.
- Fixed another exploit with Bullettin Boards. Thx to Balkon for reporting it.

01-11-04, Vjaka
- Added .pid file existance notification to warn for double sphere launches.

02-11-04, Vjaka
- Now light level for sectors is saved as LIGHT istead of LOCALLIGHT.
- One more cause for long default message string lookups removed.
- EQUIPHALO now takes an argument - time to work on a person.
- Fixed bug causing objects calculated to be in sector 0 always.
- Added @Destroy trigger for objects.

04-11-04, Vjaka
- Quickfix of OF_Magic_PreCast - now not precasting on NPCs.
- Consume now can take more than 65k at once.
- Added @CreatePlayer to trigger just after the char was created by a player.

05-11-04, Vjaka
- Now "Admin" is shown instead of "GM" if person is admin or owner in title.

06-11-04, Vjaka
- Added sector function ALLCHARSIDLE similar to ALLCHARS, but looping via
  disconnected/mounted/etc chars, not accessable by ALLCHARS.
- Added auto map fix to zero map if it is out of bounds. Please note, that
  this can cause some problems with MOREM usage as well.

25-11-04, Furio
- Fixed: encryption - client login.
- Fixed: dVALUE evaluating when VALUE is already int.
- Fixed: EQUIPHALO <timer> does not making the light disappearing.
- Updated supported clients to 4.0.6a.
- Removed "Cannot move here!" message.
- Added more information to "MOVE: empty region" error. (uid and point)

30-11-04, Furio

- Added MasterUid property to guildstones

02-12-04, Furio
- Fixed: Gm Page menu not sending gms on page select.
- Fixed: Lord is displayed without space.
- Fixed: TAGAT trying to access to non existing TAGs.
- Modified: Only items with 08000 as attr are moved to spherestatics.scp.
- Modified: Overskillmultiply is 0 by default now.
- Added: ISEVENT for regions.

08-12-04, Furio
- Fixed: EvaluatingIntel on 0 int NPCs.
- Fixed: EQUIPHALO light disappearing on Dispel.

08-12-04, Vjaka

  (thanks Breaker and Fallout for reporting this).
- Fixed canmove to accept DIR values (0..8) in addition to a letter arguments.
  Same changes affects other places, like move command, etc.
- File locking method optimised. It should improve the multithreading a bit.
- Result of the old "ACCOUNT accname" command changed to be more informational.
- GMs should login with invul and without allshow flags set.
- If reference set to OBJ/NEW does not exist, zero will be storied instead. And
  opposite, if it is already deleted, OBJ/NEW value is cleared to zero.
- Fixed exception in f_onaccount_login.

08-12-2004, Various authors
- Fixed some scripts by Vjaka.
- Added new scripts and scripts fixes by Tattooed Corpse.

---- 0.56b --------------------------------------------------------------------
---- * not released yet

09-12-04, Vjaka
- Added map caching supporting all maps. Due to this, sectors are no longer
  same in the same spot in different maps, allowing local settings for maps.
- Added ADDCIRCLE=x[,y] to add a circle to a character's spellbook. If y is on,
  includes all lower spell circles as well.
- File locking method optimised. It should improve the multithreading a bit.
- Changed [SECTOR x,y] in world saves to x,y,0,map to allow local settings for
  sectors in different maps. Old format will default to map 0.
- Since sectors are no longer shared witheen different maps, sectors on maps,
  unsupported by server (having no corresponding .mul files) do not get ticks.
- Fixed cause to duplicate saved items in static saves in several occasions.
- Added BADSPAWN command to jump to the first bad spawn found in the world. You
  should add this to some of the [PLEVEL records. It also saves the UID into
  ACT in case you unable to see it due to some obstacles.
- Removed useless PRIVHIDE (privshow 0/1 is enough for this).

10-12-04, Vjaka
- Fixed some defmessages misprint making unable to override them.
- Fixed @Kill to trigger even if the killer is not an agressor in the fight.
- Changed MAPPLANE->MAP, LOCALLIGHT->LIGHT (.56a supported both variants, but
  saved the second). Launch and save in .56a will autoconvert this in saves.
- Now any items with ATTR_STATIC are saved to spherestatics.scp, not only those
  who has this flag being the only set.
- Fixed carriage return in accounts unused message.

11-12-04, Furio
- Fixed: bugs with FORCONT* loops.
- Fixed: bug with coloured text in comm crystal.
- Added: SKILLGAIN function to call internal sphere skillgain function. Args are
  skill to gain and difficulty (0 to 100).
- Added: REPORTEDCLIVER property for clients. It'll contain the version that
  the client is. (this is easy fakeable by 3rd party programs, but still is
  useful)

13-12-04, Vjaka
- Fixed resolving functions executing on containers, if the name started from
  rescount,restest,fcount or count.
- Fixed isneartype not working if calling under points (like from TARGP).

17-12-04, Vjaka
- Account delete information now contains account name.
- Added NPC keyword GOTO x,y,z,map to execute sphere default movements there.
- Redone pathfinding to support separate thread execution, so it now utilizes
  extra thread if OF_Multithreaded is set.
- Advanced AI now includes food search on hunger to eat and gather meal around.
  It is executed in separate thread with pathfinding if configured so.

21-12-04, Vjaka
- Changed sector allocations, now allocates only those who are needed by the
  server depending on the *.mul files found. Thus, on bare t2a install no space
  for other maps will be allocated (saves several Mbytes).
- Random selection {x y} now supports format {x,y} also. Should help using it
  with DAM/AR fields of items.
- Added EXP field to characters. No internal support for it yet. But you can
  use it in scripts already.
- Empty accounts file is created on-fly if not found. Useful for unpack-n-run.
- Fixed bug with TOTALCONNECTTIME being increased by doubled value, and now is
  made more accurate.
- Optimized the UID allocation routine, trying to disallow creating holes in
  objects allocation. This should improve memory neccessaty increase for large
  or long-lasting servers. Howewer, this does not defrag the current save, only
  newly generated UIDs will be optimized - no existant UIDs will be altered.
  Garbage Collection should be enabled for this optimization to work.
- Expanded account information in ACCOUNT NAME command by logged char name.

03-01-05, Vjaka
- Added <Rarguments> as a shortcut to <eval rand(arguments)>. Can take either
  one, two or no arguments like <R>, <R15>, <R3,15>. If no arguments given,
  R1000 is assumed.
- You can now disable broadcast messages (like errors, connects, etc) from the
  server log to be sent to your account logged via telnet. You can toggle this
  behavior per account via PRIV field of the account (mask 0400). So, only
  responces to your commands and some very-basic messages (like world save)
  will be sent in this case.

08-01-05, Vjaka
- Added support for virtual maps. Now map numbers 0..255 are supported by the
  server.
- Map dimensions are now customizable in INI-file using by the following cmd:
  MAPx=max_x,max_y,sector_size,real_map_number.
  Here x - the map number for ingame useage (4rd coordinate of the coordinate).
  max_x - maximal X coordinate of the map (should be multiply of 8).
  max_y - maximal Y coordinate of the map (should be multiply of 8).
  sector_size - the sector size (you can play with this if you experience lags
    decreasing this value (should be multiply of 8 and both max_x and max_y).
  real_map_numer - number used by map files (like: 0 for map0, statics0).
  You can also change some attribute of the current map not redefining all
  values, skipping the ones you wish to be as default putting 0 instead (for
  real map number -1). For example, decreasing sector size for map 0 to 16
  from default value of 64 will look in INI file thus: "MAP0=0,0,16,-1".
  Please note, that no changes are applied when server is already started.
- Default map numbering has been changed (you can ovverride it easily by MAPx
  setting in sphere.ini). Now 0 = map0, 1 = map0, 2 = map2, 3 = map3, 4 = map4.

10-01-05, Furio
- Added: tooltip %d command for gumps (works in SE clients).
- Added: sphere_map*.scp/sphere_map_points*.scp for new maps and fixed the
  default one.
- Updated: gray proto with new packets.
- Updated: client support to 4.0.7 family.
- Updated: fix in default script pack.

13-01-05, Furio
- Modified SERV.MAP(x,y) to accept a 3rd parameter, the map. If omitted is
  defaulted to 0.
- Added SECTOR access to read-only properties from a point. Example:
  SERV.MAP(100,100,1).SECTOR.ITEMCOUNT will give you the itemcount of the
  sector that contains the point 100,100 on map 1.
- Added REGION access to read-only properties from a point. (works like
  SECTOR one)
- Fixed: gumppic to show hue when used. (Hue usable only for client >= 3)

15-01-05, Vjaka
- Changed the way the server saves allowing more information about the cause of
  some exception (which is now not fatal for the save).

17-01-05, Vjaka
- Added LEVEL field to char as the future part of the experience system.
- Added ExperienceSystem, ExperienceMode, LevelSystem, LevelMode, LevelNextAt
  fields to the .INI file as a future part of the experience system. Read the
  default sphere.ini for more description over these fields.
- PRIV flags are now auto-clearing bits corresponding to not used priv. This is
  a solution for a possible incompatibility when the previosely disabled bit
  will be reused with other functionality on same world saves.
- Fixed: LAYER_EXTRA is now used ONLY to place the items bought by the vendor.
- Items sold to vendors are auto-deleted exactly upon the sell operation. The
  only case they are saved, if they are sold to player vendors.
- Amount of items in sell packet is now limited to the container size.
- Fixed one more sell/buy exploit.

17-01-05, Furio
- Fixed: party system.
- Fixed: group disappeared from gumps.
- Added: scriptable components for the party. Still work in progress.
  With <REF>.PARTY refer to the current party of the char.
  	   <REF>.PARTY.MEMBER.x refer to any member of the party.
       <REF>.PARTY.MASTER refer to the master of the party.
  PARTY.MEMBERS give the count of members
  PARTY.MEMBER.x has also ISMASTER and ISLOOTABLE properties.
  PARTY.ADDMEMBER[FORCED] you can add a meber by script (forced  version works
       without the normal /accept behaviour)
  PARTY.DISBAND disband the current party
  PARTY.REMOVEMEMBER @<N> remove the Nth member
  PARTY.REMOVEMEMBER <UID> remove a member in the party with the UID given
       (if is the master the party is disbanded)
  PARTY.SYSMESSAGE @<N> TEXT send a party sysmessage to the Nth member
  PARTY.SYSMESSAGE <UID> TEXT send a party sysmessage to a member in the party
       with the UID given
  PARTY.SYSMESSAGE TEXT send a sysmessage to the party
  PARTY.MESSAGE @<M> TEXT send a message from the Mth member to the party
  PARTY.MESSAGE @<M>,<N> TEXT send a message from the Mth member to the Nth
       member
  PARTY.MESSAGE <UID1> TEXT send a message from the <UID1> to the party
  PARTY.MESSAGE <UID1>,<UID2> TEXT send a message from <UID1> member to <UID2>
- Added: TAG/TAG0 for party.

24-01-05, Vjaka

26-01-05, Vjaka
- Fixed registry settings overriding MULFILES setting in some cases in win32.
- Fixed the way spells are checked whatever they are in a spellbook. New type
  of spellbook (186) has been added for script purposes with internal support.
  Now the spellbooks (if not default one) can be configured to specify which
  number of the lowest spell it contains (stored in MOREZ).
- Fixed casting speel with two or more similar spell books when it does not
  exist in one of these books.
- Removed limitation to 1 byte (255) for MOREZ of spellbooks. Now it can hold
  2 bytes (65535). Please note, that setting MOREZ via MOREP is incorrect here.

28-01-05, Vjaka
- Fixed bug caused with layer_extra removal from buy menu in older clients.
- Added support for packets filterings. Please note, that you should understand
  what are you doing. You can install your handler of a packet X specifying
  PACKETx=functionname. This function will be called when the packet is going
  to be processed by the server. It has the following arguments set:
  ARGN1 = packet number (to allow using one function for different packets)
  ARGS = source client ip address
  LOCAL.0-LOCAL.9 - first 10 bytes of the packet for parsing contents
  If you do return 1 in this function, the packet will NOT be processed.
- Some exceptions debug messaging speed optimised.

29-01-05, Vjaka
- Added argument for RECRUIT on guildstone. If set 1, the member recruited will
  become a fully qualifyed member of a guild with abbriviation shown on.

30-01-05, Furio
- Fixed: compatibility problems on Linux.
- Freeze for 0.56b Test1.

03-02-05, Vjaka
- Argument switches of target[f][g][w] functions can be given in any order.
- Fixed removing events on other events execution that leaded skipping others.
- Memory usage is lowered (pre-storage optimized for more accurate values),
  approx 30-40% less memory will be used (depending on load structure).

04-02-05, Vjaka
- Logout now quits from chat removing problems with inactive zombies left.
- Characters with Statf_STONE cannot logout (actualy, have 1 hour logout timer).
- You can now access account properties using SERV.ACCOUNT.x. reference where x
  is the numerical index of the account (0..SERV.ACCOUNTS) [read-only]
- Fixed extra step made on sector borders.
- Fixed "return"/"return 2" in chardef triggers stopping others from launching.

04-02-05, Furio
- Added support for 4.0.8 clients.
- Fixed some arguments parsing in party functions

05-02-05, Vjaka
- Optimized time profiling on ticking objects.

07-02-05, Vjaka
- Problem with items left with switching virtual maps with one physical should
  be solved.
- Added simple mySQL support. New settings MySqlHost, MySqlUser, MySqlPassword,
  MySqlDatabase will be used to connect to the DB in case if MYSQL is set to 1.
  You will need extra .dll/.so to download for sphere installation. They will
  join the packages.

08-02-05, Vjaka
- Fixed several map support bugs with incorrect sector counting (should improve
  support of a high map numbers).

11-02-05, Vjaka
- Fixed bug causing incorrect function name lookup in several cases with some
  special chars like underline (_).
- Added debug flags 0200 and 0400 to debug experience and level changes from
  server console (if enabled).
- Experience system integrated. Few addons about defaults to config comments:
  a) experience bonus for crafting counted as a value/100.
  b) default experience set on create is str+dex/2+int.
  c) manual setting experience will alter level if configured so.
  d) dying decreases experience by 10%
  e) killing enemy will give experience depending on exp and level of target.

12-02-05, Vjaka
- Added 2 more EXP settings to config: ExperienceKoefPVP and ExperienceKoefPVM,
  controlling percents of gaining experience in PvP and PvM combat.
- Added triggers @ExpChange and @ExpLevelChange, where ARGN1 (writeable) is the
  change is going to happen. Returning 1 cancels the change.

12-02-05, Furio
- Fixed: another buffer overrun exploit in log system. Thx to Radiant for
  reporting it.
- Added: SUPPRESSCAPITALS (default 0) to enable/disable Vjaka system to avoid
  long text written only in capital letters.

14-02-05, Vjaka
- OF_Advanced_AI is now obsolete. Currently it is controlled by NPCAI setting
  in config file.
- Added MaxLoopTimes value to config (default 10000) to limit a number of
  iterations the while/for cycle could have to remove possible deadlocks making
  server to stop responding (better use this instead of main loop restart).
- Added MOVERATE to CHARDEFs. It is the percent modifier of the speed of the
  NPC - the higher it is, the slower will the NPC be. Default is 100.
- Now double clicking on the log window in windows build will bring up an
  editor with corresponded file (if any specifyed in the same line) opened.

15-02-05, Vjaka
- Fixed one more buy menu exploit (probably, the last one) ;).
- Fixed NEWITEM id,amount in case if non-exact value was given (like {x y}).
- Added cont argument to NEWITEM (now it looks NEWITEM id,amount,container).

16-02-05, Furio
- Fixed: compatibility things for Linux/BSD build.

27-02-05, Furio
- Added: STRREV for strings.
- Reverted to dynamic linked executable for the linux build. That permit some
  exception handling during signal raise.

01-03-05, Vjaka
- Fixed gaining fame and exp on summoned pets.
- Faster and more intelligent protection from fastloot like ,emptycontainer. The
  delays for picking now are 0.3 sec per item. Item with amount (popping dialog
  with input) adds extra 0.2 sec delay.

04-03-05, Vjaka
- Fixed an exploit with invalid book packet (thanks Fallout for reporting).
- Fixed @Destroy event not fired.
- Added the minimal delay before accepting sell/buy deal equal to 0.3 sec per
  each item. This limits the power of autobuy/autosell/inject sell all.
- Added client property CTAG similar to the TAG array. The difference is that
  the contents is not saved, and is destroyed upon logout - useful place to
  store your local variables on the client character.

06-03-05, Furio
- Some other fixes to improve Linux build stability.
- Now killing sphere with HUP make the server save and exit.
- Added support for 4.0.9 client encryption.
- Added more comprehensible messages to error output (bad login / garbage / save)

10-03-05, Vjaka
- Fixed placing items from invalid containers upon save loading to world nearby
  100,100 coords, these items should be deleted, so they are.
- Limited amount of items shown to client on screen to MaxItemComplexity*30 (by
  default 25*30 = 750).
- Removed goldreserve from guilds - use TAGs for this.
- Windows: added build date and time to the About box along with the version.

13-03-05, Furio
- Added SERV.GUILDSTONES.x to referer to the Xth guildstone in the server.
  Use SERV.GUILDSTONES.COUNT to get the total number.
- Added SERV.TOWNSTONES working like SERV.GUILDSTONES.
- Added MasterUid property also in write mode. Now you can change the guild
  master passing the uid as argument.
- Some minor fix to Linux build.

14-03-05, Vjaka
- Optimised object los check, should decrease waste of cpu on large shards.
- Fixed possible webpage exploit with malformed requests.
- Removed EMAIL property from accounts and all associated commands (EMAIL/
  ADDEMAIL,defmessages) - use account TAGs to work with it when needed.
- Removed server status responce from the standart ping/telnet connection.
- Fixed logging in localy when both RemoteAdmin and Administrator accounts were
  not found and LOCALIPADMIN was set.
- Fixed misprinted defmessage ncp_* to npc_* (2 matches), sphere_msgs.scp now
  comes commented by default - uncomment things only you need to change - most
  people will not need this file at all, so by this way we show that.

14-03-05, Furio
- Temp removed "Limited amount of items shown to client on screen".
- Moved FOLLOW from exe to scripts. Now MEMORY_FOLLOW(01000) is unused.
- Modified default info gump with a new one (thx to NHR).

17-03-05, Vjaka
- Removed EF_No_Pause_Packet, it is built in to code now.
- Drop item on vendor to trade quick, removed npc_vendor_sell (from 1.0).
- Setting SLEEPMASK=0 will give no time to sleeping sectors (from 1.0).
- Optimised few widely used checks like touch check.

29-03-05, Vjaka
- Removed debug message about not found pathfinding path.
- Fixed bug causing objects disappear on doubleclick.
- "Limited amount of items shown to client on screen" is back due this was not
  the cause of the previous bug ;).
- Removed verbose command. It was anyhow very limited in Release build.
- Added -c command line switch to WIN32 build. It allows changing registered
  class name for sphere, which helps working via windows messages with several
  sphere servers on the same machine.

05-04-05, Vjaka
- Made ARGN1 writeable in @Hunger.
- Fixed OptionFlags display instead of MagicIngoreAR.

11-04-05, Vjaka
- Packet filtering support heavily expanded. Now you have these variables:
  LOCAL.NUM (value) set to amount of data got from the packet
  LOCAL.STR (string) all data threated as a string (aware of zero chars)
  LOCAL.ACCOUNT (string) current active account if any is logged by the client
  LOCAL.CHAR (uid) current active char if any is logged in from the client
  and the all data is now given in LOCAL.x, not the only first 10 bytes.
- Returning 1 in PACKETx handler function no longer shows Bad Msg Eat string.
- Removing exception on invalid map point in some drop cases.
- Account named like account keywords (ADD/BLOCKED/etc) denied for creation.

12-04-05, Vjaka
- Walking via others with no penalty fixed (now it more like it was before in
  the times of 55i - more correct way). You can override this by changing ARGN1
  in @PersonalSpace trigger.
- Fixed message of guard owners always saying previous region guards owners.

14-04-05, Vjaka
- Fixed Sphere accepting a player character as a valid guard in some cases.
- Fixed guard walking to enemy even if they are cheaters (instantkill enabled).
- Added messaging flood control - equal sysmessages one after another will not
  be sent to the client (if they are absolutely identifical and no any other
  message was between them).
- Added STRIP [DIR/] console command. Reads all scripts and outputs them to new
  files with only [...], and base definitions lines. Good for giving script to
  your gms to be able to use axis with very basic information.

17-04-05, Vjaka
- Fixed bug with quick trade on player vendors.
- Fixed an exception caused by empty messages in some client events.

21-04-05, Furio
- Added 4.0.10 client keys.
- Fixed: bugs in getting vals from party.

21-04-05, Vjaka
- Fixed some cases (not all!) of scripts clearence by specifying incorrect
  directory in STRIP command. There are too many ways to specify direct or
  indirect path that will look different but will lead to the same file
  starting from symlinks, ending with messing with .. and dir seprarators (\/).
  Locking the file is not ok, since it will cause problems with other threads
  or applications working with file. So use this either with care, or with no
  argument ;)
- Added Axis tags support CATEGORY, SUBSECTION, DESCRIPTION to STRIP command. I
  do not use them, so did not add that when making the command :).

23-04-05, Furio
- Some fixes and optimization for Linux code.

03-05-05, Vjaka
- Fixed bug causing impossibility to dress off items in some cases.
- Removed background task and all corresponding to it operations, since they

- Fixed problems with rand(x,y).
- Disabled (temp.) Vjaka's messaging flood control.

24-05-05, Furio
- Fixed some bugs for Linux build.
- Added CanSee check in spellcast.

25-05-05, Vjaka
- Added OF_Flood_Protection as a control of toggling appearence of same
  messages and sysmessages one after another. Note, that this setting is always
  off for PLEVEL 2 or upper, so GMs will always get everything.
- Fixed copses giving unlimited blood amount. Now, the corpse gets TAG.BLOOD
  upon creation to TAG.MAXBLOOD of itemdef. You can also alter TAG.BLOOD upon
  creation on the coprse object. The default value is 5.
- Due to multiply requests, TAG.LastLogged is removed just after showing it to
  client. It is still there for the purpose to show real last connection date.
- Added INI setting of MOVERATE (default 100) to change the default moving
  speed of all NPCs at once. Remember, this is percent setting.
- Fixed bless and curse on items which lead to ultimate stats raise.

28-05-05, Furio
- Fixed: Corpse not appearing.
- Fixed: CTAG sysmessage on set.
- Fixed: FVAL bug.

18-06-05, Vjaka

- Fixed exception on allshow.
- Fixed console errors when using looms and repair.

27-06-05, Vjaka
- Removed RESOURCES2 line since it never worked at all.
- Fixed variety of bugs with using some keywords like newitem from functions
  called directly from the server (like f_onserver_start). Special char is
  created for this purpose to be acting as a default object.
- Region now executes command for all sectors inside if the command is sector
  one (you can use REGION.all* instead of REGION.SECTORS.all*) for example.
  REGION.SECTORS command is depricated.
- Added StatsFlags setting to cap MAX(HITS/MANA/STAM) status.

01-07-05, Vjaka
- Added f_onserver_exit triggered on server quit. Quite useless since no saves
  are occured after then, but good for launching some prog using sysspawn.
- Townstones are now listed in status using TOWNLIST command, splitting town
  and guild stones to different links.
- Fixed calling guards on self.

03-07-05, Vjaka
- Fixed fightself bug. It was not fixed before. I did not notice that since do
  not use default summon creature spell. Thanks Handred for reporting.
- Trying to improve the rate and distance NPC sees characters around. Now it
  should happen faster, since higher distance is checked in areas with little
  complexity.
- Spawning NPC distance is now more random. Also now spawning checks the
  borders inside disallowing to spawn in unaccessable place. Thus, if you place
  spawn in house and the doors are closed, there is no possibility for NPC to
  spawn outside the house.
- The death now triggers inventory close to avoid appearing fake items inside
  that are no longer in the pack.

04-07-05, Vjaka
- Fixed impossibility to change type of the object to a non-default one.

08-07-05, Furio

17-07-05, Furio
- Added SERV.RTIME.FORMAT. It takes as args a string like strftime()
  (the list is here http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/mansec?3C+strftime ).
  e.g SERV.RTIME.FORMAT %d returns the number of the day.
- Fixed: animal trainer problem with EF_Walkcheck.
- Fixed: magic lock/unlock bugs.
- Fixed: dagger on static crop.

19-07-05, Vjaka
- Multithreading now should be more stable.
- Few misc fixes in combat, like added los check.
- Fixed REGION.ALLCHARS command.

19-07-05, Furio

- Fixed: skill name/key/title in sphere_skills.scp
- Fixed: template mispelled (orge instead of ogre).
- Modified: sphere_map*.scp and sphere_point*.scp are now in map/
	subdir.
- Modified: only map0 and map1 scp are loaded, to load the others
	uncomment the lines in spheretables.scp

22-07-05, Cloud_Br (Script pack)
- Fixed: buying wool from vendors.

25-07-05, Furio
- Fixed: npc try to attack mounts causing exceptions.
- Fixed: mounts disappearing. (thx to Gygrazok and Darkraven)
- Fixed: args not used in trigger @PersonalSpace. (thx to Darkraven)
- Fixed: Map teleports teleporting npcs.
- Added: 4th argument to map teleports. If is set to 1 npcs can use the teleport.
	By default is 0. Eg: 1,1,1,0=100,100,100,0=my_teleport=1 is enabled,
	1,1,1,0=100,100,100,0=my_teleport=0 or 1,1,1,0=100,100,100,0=my_teleport is
	disabled.

27-07-05, Vjaka
- Fixed: Several exceptions with latest client.
- Fixed: Extra error msg for show command when server property was specifyed.
- Fixed: Some more timeslices freeing will decrease useless cpu usage in
  multithreaded mode.

30-07-05, Furio

- Fixed: x/set respecting plevel.
- Moved: hair dye gump from exe to scripts.

30-07-05, Cloud_Br (Script pack)
- Fixed: problems with spherechars_se.scp
- Added: defs to sphere_backward_compatibility.scp
- Fixed: some areas without guards (map0/map1).

30-07-05, Vjaka
- Added: MySQL support to scripts. You can execute any queries and statements,
  as well as get data from mysql link. A special script object similar to the
  FILE or OBJ added and is named DB.
  DB Properties:
    CONNECTED - the current state of database connection (1 or 0)
	ROW.NUMROWS - number of rows returned by last query
	ROW.NUMCOLS - number of columns returned by last query
	ROW.* - list of all columns returned by last query. Both column names and
	  numbers are saved in the list, so you can use indexes [0..] or column
	  names [id, name, etc] here.
  DB Methods:
    CLOSE - disconnects the SQL server
    CONNECT - connects to the database (using mysql settings in sphere.ini)
	EXECUTE - executes SQL query not filling any results anywhere
	QUERY - executes SQL query filling ROW.* properties information
  Example of a simple query:
	DB.query "SELECT id FROM users WHERE account='<SRC.ACCOUNT.NAME>'"
	SERV.log "Got ID = <DB.ROW.id>"
  Note: Server does not create connection upon start, so if you wish to make
    the connection with the server start, add DB.connect to the function
	f_onserver_start.
- Fixed: Map support higher than map 0. Now there should be no more problems
  with fix throwing to incorrect Z level (hopefully).

31-07-05, Radiant
- Added: Support for tooltips. Requires OF_Tooltips (02000) and the 020
  FeaturesLogin flag. Usable in scripts:
  	Every object has a OBJPROPS property, which works like tags. Syntax:
  	OBJPROPS.<name>=<locale id>,[args]
  	note that <name> can be anything, but the entries are sent in alphabetical
  	order. So, for example, a bag, the props would look like this:

  	OBJPROPS.a="1048032"				// a bag
  	OBJPROPS.b="1050044,32,450" // ~1_COUNT~ items, ~2_WEIGHT~ stones
- Fixed: exception occuring during load with unknown keys in sphere.ini

01-08-05, Radiant
- Added: CTAG0 similar to TAG0 version of CTAG.

03-08-05, Radiant
- Horses are now forced to dismount and will die if someone is riding them and
  they have statf_dead set or their hitpoints are 0 or below.  This should fix
  the "ghost" horses appearing sometimes (when horse is poisoned and ridden).

08-08-05, Furio
- Fixed: CTAG0 when setting a value.
- Updated: sphere_backward_compatibility.scp
- Added: FILE obj, enabled by Of_File_Commands. Look in manual.txt for help.

08-08-05, Vjaka
- Added: SQL support for multiply rows. You can use both ways ROW.<column#> and
  ROW.<row#>.<column#> for addressing a field you are interested in, but the
  first method allows operating on row #0 only.
  Sample full-n-ready script to show how to use this feature:
	DB.connect
	if ( <DB.connected> )
		db.query "SELECT * FROM mytable"
		for R 0 <eval <DB.ROW.NUMROWS>-1>
			SERV.log "--- ROW #<eval <LOCAL.R>> ---"
			for C 0 <eval <DB.ROW.NUMCOLS>-1>
				SERV.log ".. COLUMN #<LOCAL.C> : <DB.ROW.<eval <LOCAL.R>>.<eval <LOCAL.C>>>"
			end
		end
	endif
- Added: a possibility to specify MySQL port. Just add ':port' to the host
  record.
- Fixed: account references in several cases leading to errors.

11-08-05, Radiant

15-08-05, Vjaka
- Added: AutoResDisp ini setting (default:0) to setup this resdisp by default
  to all accounts. Useful if all your clients are using at least some client.
  Recommended setting at least 1 (T2A).

15-08-05, Radiant
- Fixed: potential buffer overflow exploit in file write operations
  Also saves one string operation, it's gotten a little faster.
- Fixed: CTAG/CTAG0 got broken in last fix
- Fixed: Extremely long save times
- Moved: .admin from executable to scripts and completely rewritten it.
  Please copy sphere_admin.scp from the script pack. Same is going to happen
  to .tweak.

16-08-05, Rattlehead (Script pack)
- Added: sphere_item_building_floors_se.scp (SE floor items)
- Added: sphere_item_misc_se.scp (SE misc items)

18-08-05, Radiant
- Added: exception catching around more save sections, should give a better
  description if a save error occurs

  just add a horse item
- Script sphere_admin.scp:
  - Staff can see their own IP
  - Invisible staff is now printed in red
  - Added summon cage
- Fixed: problem in saves and allskills, no check if skill is defined or not.
  Broke saves (naked players) on some servers with not all skills (AOS and SE) defined.
- Fixed: Disconnected NPCs (horses) being seen if rider is gone (probably! need feedback)

18-08-05, Gygrazok (Script pack)
- Modified: sphere_admin.scp:
  - Start position of dialogs set to 0,21
  - Default page of the tweaking menu set to "action"
  - + shown before account name for higher privs and - before guest accounts (like the old admin panel)
  - Removed PLevel informations in main page to get more space for char name
  - Closing tweak dialog brings back to main page

  setted to some value (e.g. 4.0.0) then only that client version will login
  (this is valid for encrypted and unencrypted clients). Note that sometimes
  unencrypted clients sometimes are dumb and sphere not recognize them properly
  (and thus disconnected), but after restarting the client it's all ok.

  without any trailing letter. To get the complete version (e.g 4.0.11f) use
  REPORTEDCLIVER.1.

  casting bless several times does not work).

04-07-2006, MrSugarCube
- Modified: SERV.CLIENT.x reference no longer accepts x if it is out of range
  (use SERV.CLIENTS property to check range).
- Modified: SERV.CLIENT.x reference no longer skips clients without characters
  (such as HTTP, or telnet connections), which caused strange behaviour.
  <SERV.CLIENT.x> will return 0 if the client has no attached character, 1 if
  the client has a character attached.

05-07-2006, Nazghul
- Added: A skill trigger ON=@PreStart and a character trigger ON=@SkillPreStart

22-07-2006, coruja747 (Script pack)

- Added: GAINRADIUS keyword for skill definitions. Skillgain will only be calculated if
  the current skill is less than the actual difficulty + GAINRADIUS to prohibit skillgain
  by performing way too easy tasks. If not set it defaults to 100.0 (so pertaining the
  old behaviour)

27-07-2006, coruja747 (Script Pack)

- Updated: sphere_types.scp (Fixed incorrect terrain definition for t_water)

31-07-2006, MrSugarCube

  what should prohibit NPC from passing thru walls if not explicitely stated
  (CAN-Flag mt_passwalls (08))

02-08-2006, Furio
- Added: STRREGEX(pattern,string) that execute a pattern matching supporting the
  known standard. Return: 1 match found, 0 match not found, -1 illegal pattern syntax.

04-08-2006, Nazghul
(most code revised, debugged and (re)designed by Ellessar when I was up to drop
this all in desperation)
- Added: Function AddContextEntry. what takes 2 to 4 arguments separated by a comma.
   SRC.AddContextEntry EntryTag,TextID,Flags,Color
   EntryTag - the number to return as ARGN by @(item)ContextMenuSelect. Make it unique.
            - EntryTags from 0 to 100 are reserved by Sphere for internal use, so do not
              use it.
   TextID - CLILOCed name of the button. The number from cliloc.[your_localization]
            WITHOUT the leading "300" or such! Just type "5194" or "11010"
   Flags - 01 - locked (will be grayed out)
         - 02 - consecutive entries with this flag set will be summarized under
                a golden arrow
         - 020 - can be colored
   Color (applied only if Flags & 020) - hue

- Added: Trigger @ContextMenuRequest/@itemContextMenuRequest which is fired after
  receiving a display Popup-menu client request (single click on an object).

  It can be fired two times, each call has a different ARGN.

  The first time it is fired before any hardcoded stuff is added to the Popup-menu.
  Here, Return 1 denies displaying any hardcoded entries, but if you make a softcoded
  entry, it WILL be displayed. It also will prohibit the second call of the trigger.
  Both, Return 0 and Return 2 allows hardcoded stuff to be added. If you change ARGN,
  the trigger will be called once more (but ARGN != 1).

  The second time it is fired after all hardcoded stuff was added (so you can add
  your stuff to the bottom of the Popup-menu). Return value has no effect at all.

  The first call:
   In:  ARGN = 1
   Out: Return 1 - only your stuff will be added (IF ANY), prohibits the second call
        Return 0/2 - your and hardcoded stuff will be added
        ARGN (ARGN != 1) - allows the second call

  The second call:
   In:  ARGN = 2
   Out: Return 0/1/2 - does nothing
        ARGN - does nothing

- Added: Trigger @ContextMenuSelect/@itemContextMenuSelect which is fired after
  a client selects something from a Popup-menu. ARGN is a value, which was sent
  by the server to the client as the first argument with the AddContextEntry function.

06-08-2006, MrSugarCube
- Modified: SERV.ACCOUNT.x now returns 1 if the account name or index exists, or 0 if not.
- Added: P.STATICS.x.COLOR and P.STATICS.x.Z can be used to find the colour and height
  of static items.
- Modified: Setting BONUS_STATS to 0 in SKILL definitions disables using BONUS_x properties
  when calculating stat gains for that skill instead of blocking all stat gains for it. If
  you want to prevent stat gains, you should either set STAT_x to 0, or set BONUS_x to 0
  with BONUS_STATS greater than 0.

07-08-2006, MrSugarCube (Script pack)
- Updated: sphere_msgs.scp (Fixed some 'broken' defmessages with tabs in)

- Updated: sphere.ini - added new experimental flag EF_NewPositionChecks.

16-08-2006, Nazghul
- Added: Experimental flag EF_NewPositionChecks, with this flag on,
  the new position-related checks behavior will be used. So far it does something only
  with resource gathering related skills (lumberjacking, mining, fishing, eating grass etc.)
  and Advanced LOS.
  The flag is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL!
- Modified: FORPLAYERS now loops through logouted players. If you want to loop only through
  online players, use FORCLIENTS.

17-08-2006, MrSugarCube
- Fixed: Retrieving StatLock properties with STATLOCK[statname] and SKILLLOCK[skillname]
- Fixed #835: Setting StatLocks on the status window sets the incorrect StatLock[x] property.
- Modified: Undefined region warnings are no longer reported for locations outside of the
  map boundaries.

20-08-2006, Nazghul (Changes only for servers with EF_NewPositionCheck on)
- Fixed #304: NPCs are dumber in pathfinding with EF_DiagonalWalkCheck on
  (fixed only with EF_NewPositionCheck and EF_WalkCheck on).
- Fixed #747, #767: Z not updated when you enter a multi, .fix not working inside a multi.
- Fixed #837, #829: NPCs not spawning (or on the wrong place) inside a building.
- Fixed #598: Ladders not updating Z and a player cannot step on some of them.
- Modified GOTO function: NPC will now not stop moving after the first step.

26-08-2006, Nazghul (Changes only for servers with EF_NewPositionCheck on)
- Fixed #744: Line Of Sight check going from out of a house into the house was successful,
  but not vice versa.
- Fixed: Item flags and height was always inherited from the parent item
  (the item with DUPELIST=), what damaged almost all Line Of Sight checks.

28-08-2006, Nazghul (Changes only for servers with EF_NewPositionCheck on)
- Modified: Now, archery, potion throwing, dragon breathing, stone throwing, magery can be
  used through a window.

28-08-2006, Nazghul
- Updated sphere_defs.scp: Added DEFNAME los_flags.
- Updated sphere_msgs.scp: Added message fishing_los.
- Removed: Multithreading support for Linux version due to its unusability on this OS.

30-08-2006, Nazghul
- MODIFIED: RESCOLD, RESENERGY, RESFIRE, RESPOISON now can also be set on NPC
  Remember that RES*=100 will give you a 100 percent immunity against the damage inflicted
  by TAG.*DAMAGE.
- Added: COMBAT_SPECIALDAMAGE to INI CombatFlags (08). If set, TAG.*DAMAGE (below) will be
  used.
- Added: COMBAT_USE_RESISTANCE to INI CombatFlags (010). If set, RES* on characters will
  also be weighted against normal damage if the old fashioned damage flags are set.
- Added: TAG.COLDDAMAGE, TAG.ENERGYDAMAGE, TAG.FIREDAMAGE, TAG.POISONDAMAGE for characters
  and items. The server will only evaluate the tags on characters, and if ComBatFlag
  COMBAT_SPECIALDAMAGE is set. Then any damage done to others (if it's damage type contains
  at least one of the physical types OR magic) will be increased by the value of the
  appropriate tag, lowered by the RES* percentage of the victim.
  Tags on items will not be evaluated by the server - their values can be used to for
  example increase the TAGs or the RES* properties on characters on equip of the item.
  This way you can use TAG.*DAMAGE on a weapon to increase the wearer's appropriate
  damage tag, or on a piece of armor to increase his RES*, or to whatever you want.

31-08-2006, Nazghul
- Added: NPC trigger @PetDesert. Fires when a pet decides to go wild.
  Default object is the pet, SRC the master. RETURN 1 changes the pet's mind.

31-08-2006, MrSugarCube
- Fixed: P.REGION reference not working correctly in areas defined via ROOMDEFs.
- Added: P.ROOM can be used to access the ROOM properties of a point, just like
  you can with P.REGION.
- Modified: P.REGION and P.ROOM now return 0 if a region or room doesn't exist at
  the point, and 1 if one does.
- Added: Support for the new BandageSelf and BandageTarget macros found in the
  latest clients (5.0.4). Using the macro will act as if the client has just
  targeted something with the bandage (and so @[item]TargOn_Item will be called).

01-09-2006, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #849: Enabling precasting does not freeze characters when casting.
- Fixed #849: With precasting enabled, skill is gained before the spell is
  completely cast at a target.
- Fixed #849: Harmful area effect spells don't affect the caster when
  MAGICF_CANHARMSELF is enabled.
- Fixed #849: TELE and POLY functions not working correctly with precasting
  enabled.
- Fixed #849: Casting from spellbook not working correctly with both

  debuff icons to the affected players.
- Updated: sphere.ini - added new optional flag OF_Buffs
- Added: Functions ADDBUFF, REMOVEBUFF for adding and removing buff/debuff icons.
  syntax: ADDBUFF IconId ClilocOne ClilocTwo Seconds Text1 Text2(optional) Text3(optional)
          The text fields are supposed to hold max. 3 characters each (numbers) and will
          be cut off if larger.
  	  REMOVEBUFF IconId
  These functions only work with client 5.0.3 or above.

06-09-2006, Nazghul (script pack)
- Updated: sphere_defs.scp (added defnames for buff icons and clilocs)
- Fixed: bug with i_multi_tower_wizard - the door was placed BELOW the floor,
  so unuseable with new LOS checks

07-09-2006, Nazghul
- Updated: sphere.ini - added new debug flags DEBUGF_SCRIPTS, DEBUGF_LOS.

10-09-2006, ShiryuX (Script Pack)
- Updated: sphere_defs.scp - added a defname for rideable Polar Bear

11-09-2006, Nazghul
- Fixed #852: Trigger @SKILLSUCCESS did not fire with fighting skills

12-09-2006, MrSugarCube
- Added: FORINSTANCES to loop through all instances of a given BaseID. Usage
  is "FORINSTANCES id". If an ID is not supplied then the BaseID of the default
  object will be used. Works for both items and characters.

12-09-2006, Nazghul
- Added: A new item property IsCont, which returns 1 if an item is a container and 0 if
  it is not.
- Updated: sphere.ini - added a new debug flag DEBUGF_WALK.

15-09-2006, Nazghul
- Added: INI Flag OF_NoPrefix (0x4000) to get rid of the "A" and "An" prefixes what ere
  only an annoyance for not english language shards
- Changed: Key links will only be blanked if they are pointing to an invalid item UID now.
  Before everything what was neither container nor multi was considered "invalid", so keys
  with the UID of a door, or themselves could turn blank.
- Added #848: Character trigger @SpellSelect. Doing pretty much the same as the spell trigger
  @select and has the same arguments/parameters
- Fixed #778: Wrong spellbook recognition with more than one spellbook std., necro, ...)
  in pack.
- Updated: sphere.ini - Removed experimental flag EF_New_Walkcheck.

16-09-2006, Nazghul
- Added: OF_DyeType flag to sphere.ini. If set players are allowed to use i_dye on every
  t_dye_vat instead of only i_dye_tub. Making it switcheable for all those who have concerns
  about exploitability (even as I do not see any risk) - we all remember the times when
  injection users colored whole shards pink.

17-09-2006, MrSugarCube
- Fixed: Using Bandage macro with a target prompt already present calling @TargOn_Cancel
  on the bandages.
- Fixed #863: Changing RESFIRE/RESENERGY/RESPOISON/RESCOLD properties does not update the
  client.
- Fixed: Unable to gain magery skill with precasting enabled.

  TDATA3 and TDATA4 values on a per-item-base

21-09-2006, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #875: Exception caused by setting MASTERUID when no current guild/town master
  exists.
- Modified: Setting MASTERUID to the same uid as the current guild/town master no longer
  causes an error.
- Fixed: Calling the TRAIN function on an NPC in combat would cause an error.
- Modified #869: The TRAIN function now works on all NPC brains between 2 and 9.

21-09-2006, Nazghul
- changed GAINRADIUS so that it no longer defaults to anything - if not set on a skill
  it's just transparent (as if never invented)

22-09-2006, Nazghul
- Fixed #846: Bad character DispID displayed if there was serv.chardef called no NPC
  in the world with this ID.

24-09-2006, Nazghul
- Added: Function CONTCONSUME <arg1> <arg2>, which consumes <arg2> amount of an item with id <arg1>
  from a referenced container and its subcontainers. Function does nothing on chars (use consume)
  and on non-container items.
  Example: findlayer.29.contconsume i_gold 100000
- Added: Item trigger @Buy and character trigger @itemBuy, which are called before item is sold
  by a vendor. The trigger is called only with EF_New_Triggers on.
  ACT/DEFAULT is the item, SRC is the player, ARGN is the item amount, ARGO is the vendor.
  Return 1 prevents the player from buying the item.
- Added: Item trigger @Sell and character trigger @itemSell, which are called before item is bought
  by a vendor. The trigger is called only with EF_New_Triggers on.
  ACT/DEFAULT is the item, SRC is the player, ARGN is the item amount, ARGO is the vendor.
  Return 1 prevents the player from selling the item.
- Fixed: Serv.itemdef.xxx.skill not always returning the skill
- Fixed: A copy & paste error in TAG.OVERRIDE.AMMO* what prevented the animation stuff to run.

25-09-2006, Nazghul
- Added: EF_DamageTool (0x2000) to Sphere.ini. Only if set tools/weapons will be damaged while
  lumberjacking/mining (what includes firing @Damage on them)
- Fixed: NPCs spawning with incorrect Z position.

26-09-2006, Nazghul
- Modified: @(item)ContextMenuRequest and @(item)ContextMenuSelect now will not be called with
  EF_Minimize_Triggers on.

27-09-2006, Nazghul
- Added: TDATA3 and TDATA4 of a container type item are now holding min and max coordinates of
  the "area were items may be placed", relatively to the open container gump.
  TDATA3 is (MinX * 0x10000) + MinY, TDATA4 is (MaxX * 0x10000) + MaxY
  Be very careful with these settings - if they are set to illegal values (i.e., outside of the
  visible gump) Sphere will happily accept them, but your users will not be able to pick items
  placed there out of the container, because the client will only display then if they have the
  container gump as a background!
  If TDATA4 is not set (or set to 0), default values will apply, along with the console warning
  "unknown gump id".

28-09-2006, Nazghul
- Added: MOREM value (0..127) on digestible food will override the amount of "food units"
  what will be added to the characters FOOD property when eating this. Obviously, items
  with different MOREM will not stack. Because on=@SUCCESS on cooking will not give you
  a reference to the newly created item but only to the raw one, MOREM will be transferred
  from the raw food (what you may alter in on=@success)

29-09-2006, Nazghul
- Added: 3 defmessages, thus making the headline for the "c" console command configurable.

01-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added: Intrinsic function IsObscene what tests whether the passed argument is a forbidden
  word (list of these words are in your spheretables.scp under the section OBSCENE).
- Fixed: Obscene not matching obscened words inside a string.
- Fixed #889: Fame.* and Karma.* always returning 0.
- Updated: spheretables.scp - added KARMA and FAME sections. Now you can change, add or remove
  keys which are used behind Karma. and Fame. . First line declares steps, other lines their
  names.
  IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO UPDATE YOUR SPHERETABLES.SCP!!!

02-10-2006, Nazghul (Script Pack)
- Fixed #867: sphere_minor_artifacts.scp, i_orcish_visage
- Updated: Flags notification on server startup

02-10-2006, Nazghul
- Fixed #898: Some stairs unwalkable with EF_NewPositionChecks, EF_WalkCheck and
  EF_DiagonalWalkCheck on.

05-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added: INI flag OF_OSIDamageMod (0x04)
  Modifying weapon damage OSI style, according to this formulas (originally provided by ClouD_Br):
  Tactics Damage Bonus% = Tactics � 1.6 (Add 6.25% if Tactics >= 100)
  Anatomy Damage Bonus% = (Anatomy � 2) + 5
  Lumberjack Damage Bonus% = Lumberjack � 2 (Add 10% if Lumberjacking >= 100)
  Strength Damage Bonus% = Strength * 0.3 (Add 5% if Strength >= 100)
  Final Damage Bonus% = Tactics Bonus + Anatomy Bonus + Lumber Bonus + Strangth Bonus + Damage Increase Items*
  Final Damage = Base Damage + (Base Damage * Final Damage Bonus%)
  * Damage Increase is capped at 100%.

05-10-2006, Nazghul
- Fixed #036: Fixed TRY and TRYSRV not working with locals (local and arg*). TRYSRC and TRYP
  do not work, since it makes no sense to use it on local variables. (Thx to Ellessar who
  finally worked out how this SHOULD work, so we found the bug deeply buried under tons of
  old code)

06-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added: Function ISNEARTYPETOP(.P) which uses new checks for resource gathering (item which
  you want to find must be at the top, if at the top there are 2 items, then the success
  depends on the priority (dynamic->multi->static->terrain) of those items). Syntax is the
  same with ISNEARTYPE(.P). NOTE: This function is called from hardcode if EF_NewPositionChecks
  are on.
- Fixed #668: Delete packets of items which cannot be seen were sent to the client.
- Modified #632: Now, IsPlayer can be used on every game object.
- Modified: sphere.ini - added an NPC AI flag NPC_AI_INTFOOD which enables smarter and more
  trustworthy food finding.

08-10-2006, Furio
- Modified: TRIGGER command. It now supports calling a trigger with arguments, the syntax is:
  TRIGGER $trigger_name[,$trigger_arg_type,...] where $trigger_arg_type can be:
  - TAT_AS_ARGN (1): uses arguments as ARGN. Example: TRIGGER @MyTest,<def.TAT_AS_ARGN>,1,2,3
                     will call @MyTest with ARGN1=1 ARGN2=2 ARGN3=3.
  - TAT_AS_ARGS (2): uses arguments as ARGS. Example: TRIGGER @MyTest,<def.TAT_AS_ARGS>,hi you 2,yo !
                     will call @MyTest with ARGS=hi you 2,yo !.
  - TAT_AS_ARGO (3): uses arguments as ARGN. Example: TRIGGER @MyTest,<def.TAT_AS_ARGO>,01
                     will call @MyTest with ARGO.UID=01 (only if object with such uid exist).
- Updated: sphere_defs.scp (with new definitions for the TRIGGER command).
- Fixed #880: Explode function not working as it should.

09-10-2006, Nazghul
- fixed problems with spellbooks obviously triggered by new Gcc compiler for Linux with a weird
  workaround.

10-10-2006, Nazghul
- Fixed #900: Added INI flag COMBAT_DCLICKSELF_UNMOUNT to unmount horse when dclicking self
  while in warmode.

11-10-2006, Nazghul (Script Pack)
- Updated: sphere_msgs.scp - more defmessages to customize text output.
- Updated (#905): sphere_item_provisions_potions.scp - Shrink potion did not behave as expected.

13-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added: Intrinsic functions SIN() and COS(). Attention: Without FLOAT math they will obviously
  only return 0 and 1 :)

16-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added: Support for floats (local variables FLOAT.younameit, which have size of double, and
  can hold precise numbers). Usage of these variables is the same like LOCAL.younameit. As
  EVAL only uses integer arithmetic, with FLOAT math you have to use <FLOATVAL ()>
  (New code was done mainly by Ellessar and Decrythe, I just "glued" it into Sphere :) )
- Changed: Return values for @SPELLSELECT trigger. Touchup for @SELECT with spells. Different
  server behaviour can be achieved with the following RETURN values in trigger scripts:
  @SELECT
  	RETURN 0 - proceed without mana, spellbook, and reagent check as if these checks were
  						 successful
		RETURN 1 - Abort processing (so aborting the spell)
	  RETURN 2 - proceed as normal
	  RETURN 6 - like RETURN 0 (for compatibility with @SPELLSELECT)
  @SPELLSELECT
  	RETURN 0 - proceed as normal
		RETURN 1 - abort processing (so aborting the spell)
	  RETURN 2 - proceed as normal
	  RETURN 6 - proceed without mana, spellbook, and reagent check as if these checks were
	  					 successful
  @SPELLSELECT will be called after @SELECT - what means, if you leave @SELECT with RETURN 0 or
  RETURN 1, @SPELLSELECT will NOT be called!

16-10-2006, Furio
- Added: DAM.HI/LO and ARMOR.HI/LO

17-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added: Defmessage if skillgain is aborted due to GAINRADIUS not met; message will only be displayed
  if TAG.NOSKILLMSG=1 on character
- Fixed: Problems with long passwords and MD5 hash on.

18-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added INI flag OF_DrinkIsFood (0x10000). If set, T_DRINK will increase FOOD lvl. like T_FOOD

19-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added: Dynamic property "height" for characters.

20-10-2006, Nazghul
- Updated: sphere_defs.scp - added defname charheight.

21-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added: New "m" paramter for TARGET function. Now you can use TARGETM and TARGETFM for targeting
  a place for your multi (you will see your multi in the "ghost mode"). TARGETM takes as an argument
  ONLY ID of the multi, TARGETFM takes 2 arguments - function_to_call,ID_ot_the_multi.

21-10-2006, Nazghul (Changes only for servers with EF_NewPositionCheck on and AdvancedLOS on)
- Modified: CanSeeLOS now uses height of a character for its checks. Height is read in this order
  and first correct entry is used:
  1. Dynamic height property of an object
  2. Height property under CHARDEF/ITEMDEF (can be inherited)
  3. Defname in format "height_dispid", while dispid is a hex number in Sphere format (0a3)
  4. Defname in format "height_dispid", while dispid is a dec number
  5. Universal height - "15"
  If a character is mounted, its height is raised by 4. CanSeeLOS reduce height of an unmounted
  character by 1 (pretending eyes height).
  NOTE: This formula is used when you are doing .show height, or <height> in scripts.

23-10-2006, Nazghul
- Fixed: #789 ModAR on characters only worked with damage of type GENERAL.

23-10-2006, MrSugarCube
- Fixed: Webpage requests always displaying the "Internal Server Error" page.

24-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added: Trigger @(item)Buy now has local.totalcost, which holds the cost of the whole purchase
  and ARGN2, which holds price of this amount of items (price * amount).
- Fixed: Trigger @(item)Buy returning bad amount in ARGN1.
- Added: Local variables LOCAL.CREATEOBJECT1 and LOCAL.CREATEOBJECT2 to @SUCCESS trigger of spells.
  These variables are _unset_ when the trigger is called. But they can be _set_ with field- and
  summon spells to change what these spells will create.
  - Summon spells (summon creature, bladeSpirit, Vortex, summon daemon, summon *elemental) take only
    the first one. If set with LOCAL.CREATEOBJECT1 = <eval c_orc> the spell will summon an orc. This
    way one can add more random daemons to the summon daemon spell, or change the spawned creature
    due to magery or whatever.
  - field spells (s_wall_of_stone, s_fire_field etc) take both variables, as usually the items for
    the field in west-east direction are different from those in north-south direction. If necessary
    they can of course be the same (s_fire_field looks impressive with i_fire_columns :) ), but BOTH
    have to be set (otherwise the unset will be replaced by the spell's default item for this dir).
    Example:
    [SPELL s_fire_field]
    ...
    on=@SUCCESS
      IF <magery> >= 99.9
        LOCAL.CREATEOBJECT1 = <eval i_fire_column>
        LOCAL.CREATEOBJECT2 = <eval i_fire_column>
      ENDIF

24-10-2006, Pilz-e (Script pack)

  the msg_mounted_ceiling defmessage.

25-10-2006, Nazghul
- Changed: NPC_AI flags in sphere.ini. Started splitting them up to make it easier to track
  errors related to them. The respective INI section now reads:
  // NPC AI settings
  //	NPC_AI_PATH		0001		NPC pathfinding
  //	NPC_AI_FOOD		0002		NPC food search (objects + grass)
  //	NPC_AI_EXTRA		0004		NPC magics, etc
  //	NPC_AI_ALWAYSINT	0008		Always be as smart as possible with pathfinding
  //	NPC_AI_INTFOOD		0010		NPC food search (more intelligent and trusworthy)
  //	NPC_AI_COMBAT		0040		Look for friends in combat
  //	NPC_AI_VEND_TIME	0080		vendors closing their shops at nighttime
  //	NPC_AI_LOOTING		0100		loot corpses an the way
  //	NPC_AI_MOVEOBSTACLES	0200		if moveable items block my way, try to move them
  //NPCAI=0

  completed execution.
- Modified: EFFECT property of crafting skills can now be used to define the percentage of resources
  that are lost when failing to craft an item. A few examples of how you can use this:

   "EFFECT=x,y,z"	- Lose between x% and z% of resources on fail (weighted by y)
  If EFFECT is not set then resource loss will be as normal -> 0-50% resources lost.
- Added: TAG.OVERRIDE.GUARDS on regions to specify different guards per region.

06-01-2007, MrSugarCube (Script pack)
- Updated: sphere_skills.scp (Removed EFFECT property from Alchemy and updated [COMMENT SKILL x] block)

07-01-2007, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1007: War/Peace button on paperdoll not correct when logging in with war mode.

08-01-2007, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1004: Target cursor appearing when calling functions starting with "SET" or "X".
- Added #1013: SYSMESSAGELOC, for sending localized messages to clients. SMSGL can also be used as a shortcut.
  Syntax is: "SYSMESSAGELOC color,clilocid[,arguments]"
  All arguments must be separated by a comma ",". Specify -1 for color if you do not wish to override it.
  Some examples of this being used (latest clilocs) are:
   "SYSMESSAGELOC -1,502771"			- Displays "You cannot reach that."
   "SYSMESSAGELOC 2,1042758,MrSugarCube"	- Displays "You are now loyal to MrSugarCube." in blue
   "SYSMESSAGELOC -1,1062695,MrSugarCube,4,5"	- Displays "MrSugarCube rolls the dice and gets a 4 and
						  a 5!"
- Modified #1013: '@color,font,unicode' in messages is now '@color,font,mode'. You can specify 1 for mode if
  you wish to use unicode (like before), or specify 2 if you wish to use a localized message (useful for
  overriding messages in sphere_msgs.scp). The above localization examples used with this method would be:
   "SYSMESSAGE @,,2 502771"
   "SYSMESSAGE @2,,2 1042758,MrSugarCube"
   "SYSMESSAGE @,,2 1062695,MrSugarCube,4,5"

  on a dclicked item won't be performed.

  checks on a dclicked item won't be performed.

16-01-2007, MrSugarCube
- Added #1029: @Cancel trigger to MENUs and SKILLMENUs.
- Modified: Items displayed on MENUs and SKILLMENUs can now be coloured. This can be done by prefixing the
  item description with "@color" (in the same way that sysmessages can be coloured). For example,
  "ON=i_sword_viking @2 This is a viking sword" will display a blue sword on the menu.
- Modified: Cancelling a PROMPTCONSOLE prompt no longer prevents the callback function from being called.

- Added: First version of support for TNG's webscript reader. Use console command
  "tngstrip" to create a file what contains the information TNG needs from all 
  your scripts (thus completely useless for script thieves). The file will be 
  placed at the location defined with "StripPath=" in sphere.ini and is named 
  "tngstrip.scp. Can be delivered either by a dedicated web server or the built-in 
  of sphere itself.

- Added #1079: ARGO in f_onchar_create, f_onchar_delete and f_onaccount_login 
  is now the the client that is performing the action (note that at the time 
  these functions are called, there is no character attached to the client so 
  character properties are not accessible).

22-02-2007, Nazghul
- Added: Character trigger @statchange (argn1: the stat, argn2: new value).

25-02-2007, Ellessar

  GOLD += 5000 and so on.
- Fixed: NPCs not being able to stumble upon hidden player character.

- Fixed #1098: Explosion potion activate with decay timer also if not activated.

  to a gain. ARGN1 is the skill number (e.g. 43 for wrestling), ARGN2 is the 
  skill value AFTER the change happens. RETURN 1 (or 2, or 666) means that the 
  skill will NOT change.

29-06-2007, Torfo
- Added: ADDMD5. If md5 is enabled in the sphere.ini you can use ADDMD5 to 
  bypass the hashing algorithm, if MD5 isn't enabled it's the same as ADD.
  Usage: "ACCOUNT ADDMD5 name hash"

06-07-2007, Nazghul

  comes from LocalAddress and/or 127.0.0.1

19-07-2007, MrSugarCube
- Added: Support for packet changes in client 6.0.1.7. With clients running
  on slower connections there may still be issues as Sphere cannot identify
  the 4th digit of the client version until after the client has logged in.
  If you want to override all 6.0.1.* clients to use the 6.0.1.7 packet
  changes (and thus correct the issue with slower connections, but at the
  same time remove support for 6.0.1.0-6 clients), find the following line
  in sphereCrypt.ini:
    0600010 02F2BA7ED 0A2817E7F ENC_TFISH // 6.00.10
  and change it to:
    0600018 02F2BA7ED 0A2817E7F ENC_TFISH // 6.00.18
- Added: FIXWEIGHT function for characters, which acts the same as FIXWEIGHT
  does on containers (recalculates the total weight of the items in their
  possession).

29-07-2007, Nazghul
- Just a fix in writing: Item tag.override_SKILL can also be written as
  tag.override.skill (as the other OVERRIDE tags)

04-08-2007, Ellessar
- Fixed #1239: Lumberjacking caused Sphere to crash, when failed.

 > See the sphere_item_multis_foundations.scp and add-on/House_Placement
   scripts for examples of it's use.
 > Custom houses (t_multi_custom) will be saved to a new save file named
   spheremultis.scp.
 > Note that Sphere will require access to doors.txt, misc.txt, floors.txt,
   teleprts.txt, roof.txt, and  walls.txt from the UO folder as these provide
   lists of valid items. Also, all these items should exist in scripts for them
   to be added to a building - note that the default script pack is currently
   missing several sets of floors and walls.
 > New functions and properties have been added that can be used with items of
   the type t_multi_custom. These are:
   -- References --
    "DESIGNER"            The player currently designing the building.
   -- Properties --
    "COMPONENTS"   (r)    The number of components in the building design.
    "FIXTURES"     (r)    The number of fixtures in the building design (doors
                          and teleporters/t_door and t_telepad).
    "DESIGN.x.KEY" (r)    Accesses component x in the building design and
                          returns the given property. Possible properties are:

                            DX: The x offset of the component.
                            DY: The y offset of the component.
                            DZ: The z offset of the component.
                            D:  The x,y,z offset of the component.
                            FIXTURE:  Returns 1 if the component is a fixture.
    "DESIGNER"     (r)    The uid of the player designing the building (or 0).

    "REMOVEITEM id,x,y,z" Removes an item from the building design (see
                          COMMIT). If the given id is 0 then any items found
                          at the location will be removed.
    "RESET"               Resets the building to it's default state (see
                          COMMIT).

                                      logging out).
                            ARGO:     The building being designed.
                            RETURN 1: Keeps the client in design mode (if ARGN1

  unexpected things will happen if you've set this to be a non-magic skill (for
  example, Begging), so make sure the SKF_MAGIC flag is set on such skills.
  
14-12-2007, coruja747 (Script pack)
- Updated: sphere_item_building_walls_se.scp (Missing item 02753)

- Updated: sphere_item_christimas.scp (Incorrect RESDISPx settings on i_Sleigh)
- Updated: sphere_map_points2.scp (Inaccessible teleports on Exodus Dungeon)

21-12-2007, MrSugarCube
- Modified: Ships now move 2 spaces at a time instead of 1. This reduces a lot
  of lag caused by ship movement and also fixes overhead messages disappearing
  whilst the ship is in motion.
- Added: SHIPSPEED property to ship ITEMDEFs. This controls how often and how far
  the ship will move. SHIPSPEED.PERIOD and SHIPSPEED.TILES can be used to return
  the separate values. Usage:
    "SHIPSPEED=5,3"     Ship will move 3 tiles every half a second.
    "SHIPSPEED=1,5"     Ship will move 5 tiles every tenth of a second.
    "SHIPSPEED=20,2"    Ship will move 2 tiles every 2 seconds.
  Note 1: If there is less space available than specified by SHIPSPEED.TILES,
  the ship will still move as far as possible before stopping (so if a ship is
  set to move 10 tiles and is heading towards a coast that is 16 tiles away, the
  ship will move 10 tiles, then 6 tiles, and then stop.
  Note 2: TAG.OVERRIDE.SHIPSPEED.PERIOD and TAG.OVERRIDE.SHIPSPEED.TILES can also
  be set on the ships themselves to override their speed on an individual basis.

22-12-2007, Nazghul
- Added: Triggers @NPCAction and @NPCSpecialAction
  @NPCSpecialAction
  If the NPC has a lot of spare time (i.e., nothing else to do) it
  looks for some special action. For example, giant spiders lay webs,
  and fire elems leave fire patches. This trigger fires on ANY type
  of creature. If you return 1, it will not do it's special action,
  on return 0 it will (what, as said above, will only be true with
  giant spiders and fire elems; you can script other NPC special
  events yourself).

  @NPCAction
  AI-related trigger. If the situation is so the NPC will do something
  due to it's AI - things like animals pooping the ground, vendors
  going off/on duty, (un)equipping a lightsource when it's dark, 
  (un)equipping a weapon when fighting, stabler feeding animals or
  giving players food for their animals etc. - (once hardcoded behaviour
  was planned also for beggars who should sleep at night, for thieves,
  undead mages, healers, and more, but never realized. Now you can script
  this yourself) this trigger will be fired. On RETURN 0 
  the NPC will continue with what it wants to do, RETURN 1 will abort it.

  Both triggers will fire only if EF_NPCAct_Triggers is SET and 
  EF_Minimize_Triggers is NOT SET in the sphere.INI. SO if you don't
  change your INI, everything will stay as it was before.

22-12-2007, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1341: Arguments not being parsed correctly for commands entered
  on the console.
- Fixed #1331: Script verbs not being parsed correctly when there is a
  space in them (ie. TAG.xxx_<EVAL yyy> = zzz).

04-01-2008, Nazghul
- Added: Triggers @Mount and @Dismount, both are character trigger, firing 
	when a character tries to mount/dismout it's ride (and will be able to).
  @DISMOUNT
    ARGO is the UID of the (still disconnected!) pet.
    RETURN 1 stops the dismount process.
  @MOUNT
    ARGO is the UID of the NPC bound to be ridden.
    RETURN 1 stops the mounting process.

- Fixed: ++/-- in scripts being parsed as +=1 when not being used as operators.

  properties that can be accessed (read only) are:
  BOUND.X = maximum x for the map
	BOUND.Y = maximum y for the map
	CENTER.X = x coord of map center
  CENTER.Y = y coord of map center
	SECTOR.SIZE = size of sectors
	SECTOR.ROWS = qty of sector rows for the map
  SECTOR.COLS = qty of sector columns for the map
  SECTOR.QTY = total number of sectors for the map
- Added: FeatureKR and Kr reslevel (6). Guess what they do (it's a wip).
- Added: EF_UseNetworkMulti (00800000) to experimental flags. Tired of crashing due
  too many items/npcs, try it. Don't change it while the server is running.
  (Thx to Z. for the windows version)

21-01-2008, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1311: NPC Pathfinding failing when EF_DiagonalWalkCheck is enabled.

  DIALOGLIST.$x.ID ($x = a number between 0 and DIALOGLIST.COUNT-1) the ID of the
  respective gump dialog, and DIALOGLIST.$x.COUNT the number of active instances of
  this dialog. So to close a specified gump, DIALOGCLOSE <DIALOGLIST.$n.ID> should do.
- Added KRTOOLBARSTATUS (prop/verb) and @UserKRToolbar (ARGN1 type, ARGN2 arg) to
  interact with the hotbar in the KR client.

03-02-2008, Shadow Dragon
- added @KarmaChange, @FameChange. Called when Karma/Fame adjusting.
  ARGN1 = Karma/Fame modifier, it's writable.
  return 0 will use Argn1 value in adjusting.
  return 1 will break adjusting.

  them), negotiate corners with EF_DiagonalWalkCheck enabled, and attempt to compensate
  when new obstacles block a previously valid path.
- Fixed #1390: Locals not working in SKILLMENUs.

28-04-2008, coruja747 (Script pack)

- Modified: GOLD property adds new gold stacks to bankbox.

21-05-2008, Nazghul 
- Added: Combat flags to Sphere.ini to allow stacking armor and aimed hits. Example of usage
  is in scripts/AddOns. 
  Aimed hits are controlled by tags on the "hitter": TAG.HITPREFERENCE holds the targetted
  zone: 1=head, 2=neck/throat, 3=back, 4=chest, 5=arms, 6=hands, 7=legs, 8=feet (if the value
  is out of this range it will be changed by %9; "0" means: no preference set);
  TAG.HITPREFERENCE_CHANCE (0..1000) is the chance to really hit the desired area;
  TAG.HITPREFERENCE.BONUS is the percent the damage is raised when hit where desired,
  TAG.HITPREFERENCE.PENALTY is the percent the damage is lowered if the area was missed.
  The last two values are defaulting to "30".
  The system is perhaps useful to script a system where a player can look for weak armored
  bodyparts of his opponent and try to hit him there; could be essential if armor stacking
  is used.

  Only valid if PRECAST is activated by Sphere.ini

08-07-2008, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1446: GM/MT_FLY enabled characters walking through stairs when EF_WalkCheck is not
  enabled. [Note: Due to potentially negative side-effects of this fix a temporary EF flag
  (EF_NoWalkingThroughStairsFix) has been added to sphere.ini which disables the fix just in
  case something bad happens (if no issues are reported that are caused by this fix then you
  can expect it to disappear very soon)]

10-07-2008, MrSugarCube
- Fixed ##3: Unstackable items becoming stacked after being bought off a player-owned vendor,
  when the buyer cannot carry the items.
- Fixed ##2: NPC_AI_FOOD causing NPCs to get stuck whilst they attempt to eat grass from a

13-07-2008, Beyonder
- Fixed ##1: Sphere crashes with Experimental Flag UseNetworkMulti.

- Fixed #1449: Damage spells backfire when selecting summon while casting.

15-07-2008, Beyonder

  skills:
  LOCAL.CRAFTITEMDEF - the UID of defname of the item we are currently crafting. Readable/Writable.
  Accepts ONLY UIDs of ITEMDEFs, for example:
	if (<LOCAL.CRAFTITEMDEF> == <DEF.i_katana>)
		LOCAL.CRAFTITEMDEF = <DEF.i_sword_long>

  otherwise will make no effect. Readable/Writable.
- Modified: @Destroy on items and characters is triggered before deletion, not after. This way
  all of the item/character properties are fully accessible.
  "return 1" forbids deletion. WARNING! putting return 1 in this trigger means it won't be deleted
  in any possible way! Use it with caution.

  uncommitted changes that have been made to the building design.

03-09-2008, Nazghul
- Added #1504: Optional second parameter "amount" to MAKEITEM. Please understand that the
  "additional" items crafted will neither fire any trigger, nor give experience or skill. So,
  from that point of view there's no difference between "MAKEITEM i_dagger" and "MAKEITEM i_dagger,10"
  (except for the number of daggers created). If the resources you have are insufficiant for
  the amount, it will be shortened respectively.

08-09-2008, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1514: Players and NPCs unable to cast spells.
- Fixed #1508: Dropped items stacking regardless of their difference in height.

09-09-2008, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1516: NPCs unable to use pathfinding when trying to follow or walk up to another character.

13-09-2008, MrSugarCube
- Added: BASECOMPONENT property to multis. Usage is similar to COMPONENT except it returns
  information for the components specified in the mul files, and when accessing
  individual components (BASECOMPONENT.n.[ID/DX/DY/DZ/D] there is an additional "VISIBLE"
  property which returns 0 if the component is invisible (usually applies to doors and signs).

16-09-2008, Nazghul
- Added: Override Tags for item/action related sound.
  TAG.OVERRIDE.DOORSOUND_CLOSE / TAG.OVERRIDE.DOORSOUND_OPEN 
    (what it does should be obvious)
  TAG.OVERRIDE.PORTCULISSOUND - holds an sfx number played when 
    opening/closing a portculis
  TAG.OVERRIDE.DROPSOUND - sfx an items makes when dropped. Att:
    system default sounds sometimes change due to the amount dropped
    (gold, ingots), or on what surface/item the item is dropped. All
    this will be overridden!
  TAG.OVERRIDE.SOUND_HIT - on weapons holds the sound when it hits,
    regardless of WHAT it hits!
  TAG.OVERRIDE.SOUND_MISS - on weapons, sound they make when missing

  all TAGs need to hold a number (defname MAY be possible -> test!),
  what also can be "0" (zero) with the meaning: don't play any sound.

17-09-2008, Nazghul
- Added: Trigger @PICKUP_STACK what fires only if an item was picked up from a pile.
  ARGO is the remaining part of the stack. (There's a char trigger itemPICKUP_STACK

- Added: TAG.OVERRIDE.RUNNINGPENALTY and TAG.OVERRIDE.STAMINALOSSATWEIGHT to

- Modified: IsNearType (including IsNearType.P) now accepts a third parameter, which when set to 1
  will cause the function to include multi components in the search.
- Added: New mt_mount flag (00400) which will allow character bodies to become capable of mounting
  rides. Note that this flag is not required for the bodies that could already mount rides prior
  to this flag's existence (c_man/c_woman/c_man_gm/c_elf_man/c_elf_woman). Also be aware that not
  all character bodies are intended to be used for mounting rides and won't have proper riding
  animations.

29-11-2008, MrSugarCube (Script pack)
- Updated: sphere_defs.scp (Added mt_mount to the can_flags defname section)

  when showing guild member titles)

07-12-2008, MrSugarCube
- Added #1086: Skill degradation for skills that have been set to decrease. @SkillChange trigger
  is called for decaying skills just as it does when they gain (compare <ARGN2> to <<ARGN1>> to
  determine if the skill is being increased or lowered).
- Added: Experimental flag EF_UseNetworkMultiVersionMod. This modifies the behaviour of the
  EF_UseNetworkMulti flag (don't forget to set this too) so that clients older than 4.0.0 will
  be unaffected and continue to use the original networking code as if the EF_UseNetworkMulti
  flag was never set.

03-01-2009, Dwayne1988 (Script pack)
- Updated: spherechar_human.scp, spherechar_evil.scp (Axis Tags were messed up, came after

  use that item." being sent to players as they try to free themselves from spider webs.
- Added #1564: PetsInheritNotoriety setting to sphere.ini. This can be used to specify which
  notoriety flags a pet will inherit from its master (so if for example a pet has an evil owner
  and the NotoEvil flag is set then the pet will also show as evil regardless of its real notoriety).

22-02-2009, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1575: Improved handling of unicode speech in Linux build.
- Fixed #1537: TEST in skillmenus not being parsed in the same way as TESTIF.

  when precasting is enabled.

  for individual spells.

06-05-2009, MrSugarCube

  casting a spell the player is given this many seconds to choose a target before the spell is
  automatically cancelled.

- Modified #1610: Cure spell just sends the packet needed to update the health bar rather than sending
  a full refresh of the entire screen.
- Added #1609: MAGICF_SUMMONWALKCHECK flag to ensure that summoned creatures can only be successfully
  summoned on tiles that are walkable for them (i.e. a sea creature can only be summoned on water).

20-05-2009, MrSugarCube
- Added #1604: PROMPTCONSOLEU function. This is an alternative to the PROMPTCONSOLE which enables the
  client to respond with unicode text.
- Added: SYSMESSAGELOCEX, an extended version of SYSMESSAGELOC which can be used for sending localized
  messages to clients with a non-localized string attached to the start or end of the message. SMSGLEX
  can also be used as a shortcut.
  Syntax is: "SYSMESSAGELOCEX color,clilocid,flags,affix[,arguments]"
  All arguments must be separated by a comma ",". Specify -1 for color if you do not wish to override
  it. Known possible values for flags are:
    0x00 = Append text to message
    0x01 = Prepend text to message
    0x02 = Forces message to show as a system message
  A couple of examples of this being used (latest clilocs) are:
   "SYSMESSAGELOCEX -1,1008078,01,MrSugarCube"                    - Displays "MrSugarCube : Attempting to heal you."
   "SYSMESSAGELOCEX -1,3002003,00,Smoking is bad for your health" - Displays "Note to self:  Smoking is bad for your health"
  For overriding messages in sphere_msgs.scp (or other message functions such as SAY and MESSAGE) the
  syntax "@hue,font,3 clilocid,flags,affix[,arguments]" can be used, for example:
   "SAY @022,,3 1008097,01,MrSugarCube"                           - Object says "MrSugarCube : poisoned you!" in red

30-05-2009, Nazghul
- Fixed: @GetHit always gave damagetype type (argn2) 0C02 (physical | slash | pierce). Now the type is set 
  to dam_physical, dam_slash or dam_pierce is added depending on weapon type (wrestling and mace weapons
  don't set extra flags).
- Added: TAG.OVERRIDE.DAMAGETYPE for weapon type items. Holds a numerical value and overrides the
  type specific damage type.

20-06-2009, MrSugarCube

07-09-2009, MrSugarCube
- Added: Console command "d ui" to generate a file named "unscripted_items.scp" that
  contains *basic* definitions for items in tiledata.mul that have no corresponding
  Sphere script.

12-09-2009, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1623: RESTEST requiring 1 of an item when checking for a quantity of 0. This also
  affects other resource-list-based functions and properties such as CONSUME, FOODTYPE,
  RESOURCES, SKILLMAKE, SKILLTEST, etc.
- Fixed #1655: Setting RAINCHANCE and COLDCHANCE to zero does did not disable rain or snow.
- Modified: When loading a WORLD* block from a save Sphere can resolve defnames to find the
  object being loaded (like the ones in sphere_backward_compatibility.scp, for example).

12-09-2009, Coruja (Script pack)
- Updated #1645: sphere_template_vend.scp, sphere_item_resources.scp, spherechar_human.scp,
  sphere_item_provisions_potions.scp, sphere_backward_compatibility.scp (Corrected spelling
  of the wyrm heart defname (i_reag_worm_heart->i_reag_wyrm_heart))
- Updated #1654: sphere_defs.scp (Adjusted height of the Meer characters)

13-09-2009, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1595: @Destroy trigger not being fired for items inside removed containers. When
  returning 1 in @Destroy on an item inside a container about to be deleted, the item will
  be dropped to the ground (unless the item has already been moved elsewhere).
- Fixed #1656: Exception when players trade and item 01e5e has not been set as a container
  type.

05-12-2009, MrSugarCube
- Fixed: Unable to connect to remoteadmin from telnet clients that operate in 'line mode'
  and need the enter key to be pressed after CTRL+A/Space (the one in Ubuntu, for example).
- Modified: Rewritten networking system, based on the code Vjaka wrote for 0.57 combined
  with updates added since such as EF_UseNetworkMulti. This new system introduces features
  such as packet prioritisation which should help to keep clients responsive even in areas
  with a large number of objects.
  The EF_UseNetworkMulti and EF_UseNetworkMultiVersion experimental flags have been removed
  from the ini and different settings have been added to a new "Network Behaviour" section.
  The default settings should suit most users, but in some cases it may help to tweak the
  MaxPacketsPerTick and MaxQueueSize settings.

06-12-2009, MrSugarCube
- Added: Support for gargoyle character creation. For the option to be available the player
  must have a RESDISP of 7+ and the FEATURE_SA_UPDATE flag needs to be enabled in Sphere.ini.
  ARGN3 in the f_onchar_create (sphere_serv_trigger.scp) is now the character race (1=human,
  2=elf, 3=gargoyle).
- Added: Basic support for mysticism spellbook and skill (the actual spell effects need to be
  scripted).
- Added #1657: Support for the increased tiledata size in client 7.0.0+. As a consequence,
  multis must now start from 08000 instead of 04000 and scripts must be adjusted accordingly
  (the default script pack has been updated). If an older client encounters an item within the
  04000-07fff range they will only see a worldgem bit (01ea7).
- Fixed #1661: Status bar not correctly showing green or yellow in 7.0.0+ clients.
- Modified: The size of Map5.mul is now automatically detected.

06-12-2009, MrSugarCube (Script pack)
- Added: spherechar_sa.scp (Added gargoyle character definitions)

  sphere_item_multis_stairs.scp (Increased multi IDs by 04000)
- Updated: spheretables.scp (Added sphere_map5.scp and sphere_map_points5.scp to resources,
  commented out by default)

12-12-2009, MrSugarCube
- Added: Support for gargoyle flying ability. Flying characters will have statf_hovering set
  on their FLAGS property and will be allowed to pass over items that have the CAN_I_HOVER
  flag set.
  The exact effects of the statf_hovering flag are:
   - Can pass over hidden 'hover over' tiles to get to special areas
   - Can move at the same speed as a mounted player
   - Height is increased by 4 in LOS/movement checks (same effects as when mounted)
   - When stamina is lost on movement, the running penalty is always applied
   - Always revealed when moving whilst hidden
   - Will not teleport off ships when moving on to a ship plank
- Added: MULTIDEF block. This can be used to safeguard against any future changes to the size
  of tiledata.mul. This basically acts as a 'shortcut' for ITEMDEF, except the ID will 
  automatically be increased by 08000. Items defined with this are still accessible as normal
  via SERV.ITEMDEF.id(+08000)/defname, or SERV.MULTIDEF.id/defname can be used if you prefer
  for consistency.
- Added #1674: PINS property to maps, to return the number of pins on the map.
- Fixed #1672: Situations where returning 0 in a trigger would return as 2.

12-12-2009, MrSugarCube (Script pack)
- Updated: sphere_defs.scp (Added defnames for statf_hovering, mt_hover, can_i_hover,
  tilef_hoverover, t_hoverover)

- Updated #1684: sphere_item_magic_armor.scp, sphere_item_magic_leather.scp,
  sphere_item_magic_weapon.scp, sphere_item_misc.scp, sphere_item_profession_cartographer.scp,
  sphere_item_provisions_armor_color.scp, sphere_item_provisions_deed.scp,
  sphere_item_provisions_ore.scp (Replaced custom script IDs with defnames to fix conflicts
  with new tiledata size -- some items did not have a defname so watch out if you have any of
  these in an existing world save)

13-12-2009, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1683: Hiding skill not properly updating clients to show the character is gray.
- Added #1678: Logging for commands issued via telnet. "TelnetLog" setting can be used
  to enable or disable this feature.
- Modified: The -E switch now shows a message in the console to indicate that is has been
  successfully enabled.

13-12-2009, Coruja (Script pack)

  spinning wheel)

13-12-2009, MrSugarCube (Script pack)

  defmessages are displayed.

  leading to possible exceptions.

19-12-2009, MrSugarCube (Script pack)
- Updated: sphere_item_profession_barber_sa.scp (Fixed defname conflicts)

20-12-2009, MrSugarCube
- Added #1667: PARTY.SETMASTER, accepts either a character uid or @<N> for the Nth party
  member, to change who the party master is. The character must be an existing member of the
  party and cannot already be the master.
- Added #1658: @TargetCancel trigger to spells (and @SpellTargetCancel to characters). This
  is called when a player cancels targeting with a spell.
    ARGN1 = the spell that was being cast
    ARGO  = the item used to cast the spell (e.g. a wand or scroll)
    RETURN 1 = suppress the cancellation message
- Added: @Wait trigger to skills (and @SkillWait to characters). This is called whenever
  Sphere wants to check if a character must wait before starting a skill. Normally this
  will be when a skill is selected from the skill menu (before @Select), but also when
  snooping a container or using a musical instrument.
    ARGN1 = the skill the character is attempting
    ARGN2 = the skill that is currently being used
    RETURN 0 = The character can start the other skill (bypasses default checks)
    RETURN 1 = The character must wait (bypasses default checks)
    RETURN 2 = Perform default checks
- Fixed: Return 0 not working in @UseQuick trigger.
- Fixed: @TargOn_Cancel trigger not being fired.
- Modified #1687: Clients are now listed in order of newest to oldest.
- Modified: TDATA1 and TDATA2 can be set on maps to specify the width and height of the gump.

03-01-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1700: Armor rating not updated when being resurrected.

  is called when a player cancels targeting with a skill.
    ARGN1 = the skill that was being used
    RETURN 1 = suppress the cancellation message

10-01-2010, MrSugarCube
- Added #1705: @RegionResourceFound trigger, fires on characters just before @ResourceFound
  is fired on a region resource (shares the same arguments and return values).
- Fixed #1706: Light sources not showing correctly on 7.0.0+ clients.
- Fixed: Guard command not working with pets.
- Modified: Pets default to guarding their master instead of following, and no longer attack
  the same target as their master when in "follow" mode.

17-01-2010, MrSugarCube
- Added: Experimental flag "EF_NetworkOutThread". If this is enabled then outgoing data will
  be sent in a separate background thread.
- Added: UsePacketPriority setting in sphere.ini. Leaving it at 1 (default) should be best
  but if this is set to 0 then [most] packets won't be prioritised.

24-01-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1713: Strange characters in the tip of the day window.
- Fixed: Previous and Next buttons not working on the tip of the day window.

25-01-2010, MrSugarCube

21-03-2010, MrSugarCube

04-04-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1734: No response sent for UOG and CUO status requests.
- Modified: (Windows) Status window now uses a courier font so that data is aligned like it
  is when using 'p' in the console.
- Modified: Improved accuracy of profile data ('p' in console, or status window in Windows)
  by recording and displaying it for each thread.

17-04-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed: Wrong mapdif*.mul and stadif*.mul files being used with custom maps.
- Modified: If Map1.mul is present then it will automatically be used.

- Fixed #1746: Damage showing in the corner of the screen instead of above an enemy when
  UsePacketPriority is enabled.

23-05-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1751: Movement/sight checks fail when an item is too tall to fit within the Z
  boundaries.

24-05-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1756: Packets being sent for items in containers the client cannot see inside (A
  side-effect of this is that CANSEE/LOS will return 0 for such items, until the client
  opens/snoops the container).

25-05-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1754: Armor rating in status window not updated when equipped armor pieces receive
  damage.

29-05-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1759: Client not always notified about login failure when EF_NetworkOutThread is

- Fixed #1760: Players unable to see items in the other player's trade window.

13-06-2010, MrSugarCube
- Added: 'TooltipMode' setting to sphere.ini. When this is set to '1', instead of always
  sending a full tooltip packet for every item, Sphere will send a smaller 'header' packet
  and wait for the client to request the full information (for unchanged tooltips, clients
  can use a local cache and less data will need to be sent).
  Note: Since the header packet requires knowledge of what the tooltip will contain,
  @ClientTooltip should be expected to fire twice in this mode (once for the header, once
  for the full data). ARGN1 can be used to determine if the client asked for the tooltip,
  but it is important that you do not use it to change the tooltip content.
- Added: Support for caching tooltip data for characters and items. Whilst a tooltip is
  cached, @ClientTooltip won't be fired. A new 'TooltipCache' setting is provided in
  sphere.ini to control how long a cached tooltip will be valid for (set to 0 to disable
  caching). If the new tooltip mode is being used then enabling this would be advisable
  to avoid having @ClientTooltip fired twice for each client.
- Modified: RESENDTOOLTIP now accepts parameters to control how the tooltip should be
  sent.
  The syntax is now: "RESENDTOOLTIP [sendfull=0,usecache=0]"
   'sendfull' - 1 to force the full tooltip to be sent, or 0 to send just the header (when
                TooltipMode=1, otherwise the full data will be sent anyway)
   'usecache' = 1 to use cached tooltip if available, or 0 to clear the cache and force
                @ClientTooltip to fire

02-07-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed: Possible exception on Linux builds when an NPC moves.

03-07-2010, MrSugarCube
- Modified #1761: The fix for issue #1756 (sending packets for items inside unopened
  containers) must now be activated using the EF_FixCanSeeInClosedConts experimental flags,
  since it has been reported to cause client crashes.

28-07-2010, MrSugarCube
- Added #1776: P.COMPONENTS to access multi components at a location in the same way as with
  P.STATICS. Usage is identical to P.STATICS, except that the COLOR property does not exist
  for multi components. P.COMPONENTS.n.MULTI can be used as a reference to the multi that
  contains the nth component at a location.

06-08-2010, ShiryuX
- Added #1790: TAG.NOTO.PERMAGREY which sets the player's notoriety to neutral/grey.
  This will only happen if the character is blue, everything else will override it.

- Fixed #1772: Cooking skill wasn't counted as a crafting skill.

07-08-2010, ShiryuX (Script pack)

15-08-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1722: Game clients unable to connect when the server IP is set to 127.0.0.1.

17-08-2010, ShiryuX
- Added #1566: MD5PASSWORD account function/property to instert or change a MD5 hash as password.
  This way you can call: "SERV.ACCOUNT foobar MD5PASSWORD f4d9ff51c527e8ef67d924d4f0a6db66"
- Fixed #1799: Accounts created using ADDMD5 won't cut the hash anymore.
- Fixed: Dialog properties xmfhtmlgump and xmfhtmlgumpcolor not working correctly with dorigin. 

19-08-2010, ShiryuX
- Modified #1786: Disabled 'r' console command to be used by remote telnet, use 'resync' instead. 
  Any other way to access the console (physical or remote desktop) can still use it.

21-08-2010, ShiryuX
- Added: Basic support for bard spellbook and skill (the actual spell effects need to be scripted).
- Modified #1800: @UserWarMode will now have ARGN2 parameter, which by default is 1.
  ARGN2 = 1 --> Will abort the skill action
          0 --> Will _NOT_ abort the skill action

  versions (7.0.8.0+) are able to use this value to view maps other than map0.mul.

23-08-2010, MrSugarCube (Script pack)
- Updated: sphere_msgs.scp (Updated npc_vendor_s1 and npc_vendor_b1 defmessages)

  sphere_item_provisions_weapons_sa.scp (These files now contain all the default scripts
  for Stygian Abyss weapons, armor, clothing, jewelry, and other miscellaneous items.
  As a note: all throwing weapons use the t_weapon_sword type. There is no archery
  animations for gargoyles)
- Updated: sphere_skills.scp (Added FLAGS=skf_ranged|skf_fight to the throwing skill (Skill 57))

09-09-2010, MrSugarCube

  completes.
- Fixed: Large packets sent by the client sometimes not parsed correctly, leading to strange
  behaviours or console errors.

30-09-2010, ShiryuX
- Fixed #1825: not writable books not displaying content for 5.0.0+ clients.
- Modified: Axis strip to use only ONE file to dump the stripped scripts (like TNG strip does)
  Commands are = TNG: "strip tng" or "tngstrip" (dump file sphere_strip_tng.scp)
                 Axis: "strip axis" or "strip" (dump file sphere_strip_axis.scp)

04-10-2010, MrSugarCube

09-10-2010, ShiryuX
- Added: "TAG.OVERRIDE.NOTO" and "TAG.OVERRIDE.NOTO.$uid" as notoriety flag overrides.
  TAG.OVERRIDE.NOTO is a general override for the notoriety flag.
  TAG.OVERRIDE.NOTO.$uid overrides the noto flag according to the viewer $uid.
  * NOTE: The general override is applied before the viewer tag. So it will override EVERYTHING.
          Usable flags can be found on sphere_defs.scp

09-10-2010, ShiryuX (Script pack)
- Updated: sphere_defs.scp (added noto_types defintion)

11-10-2010, Khaos (Script pack)
- Updated: sphere_item_provisions_weapons_sa.scp (fixed some typos)
- Updated: spherechar_human.scp (Female barber was using male barber names instead of
  the female name list)

13-10-2010, MrSugarCube
- Added: Support for packet changes found in client 7.0.9.0.
- Added: Support for new tiledata.mul and multi.mul formats found with client 7.0.9.0.
  Since the tiledata size has increased again (supporting a maximum slot of 0FFFF),
  multis must now start from 010000. If multi scripts are already using the new MULTIDEF
  syntax then everything should work without any change to scripts.

14-10-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1832: Exception on Linux build when logging in.

18-10-2010, MrSugarCube

- Added: Race selectors to newbie templates. Code works as follows: [newbie xxx <race>] Races
  that can be set are "human", "elf", "gargoyle", or leave it default for normal functionality.
  This works for the male_default, female_default, and all the skills defined in Newbie sections.
- Added #1598: All max* stat values (Hits, stam, mana, food) can be _safely_ set up to 1 million.
  Though you can go past this, we don't recommend it. Note: This should not be used on players
  max values, and we _highly_ don't recommend it.

- Fixed: Exception on linux build when accessing guild functions without an SRC.

14-11-2010, MrSugarCube

12-12-2010, MrSugarCube
- Added #1865: ARROWQUEST function now accepts a third parameter to specify the arrow's id
  (defaults to 0). This can be used to display more than one arrow at once on newer clients,
  but bear in mind that older clients can still only show one arrow at a time and so the id
  will effectively be ignored in their case.
  If an id has been specified when showing the arrow, then you will also need to specify it
  again when you want to remove it ("ARROWQUEST" with no arguments will only remove the arrow
  with id 0).
    ARROWQUEST 1000,1000,0 // show an arrow pointing to 1000,1000, id=0
    ARROWQUEST 1020,1000,1 // show an arrow pointing to 1020,1000, id=1
    ARROWQUEST 1000,1020,2 // show an arrow pointing to 1000,1020, id=2
    ARROWQUEST 0,0,1       // remove the arrow pointing to 1020,1000

26-12-2010, Coruja (Script pack)

  candelabras)

08-01-2011, MrSugarCube
- Added #1845: Support to automatically invalidate and resend tooltips when certain properties
  change on items or characters, via new AUTOTOOLTIPRESEND setting. See Sphere.ini for
  available flags that can be used to control which properties are monitored. Note that some
  scripts won't trigger the tooltips to resend (for example the 0008 flag won't detect a script
  that sets MORE1 on armour, so a manual RESENDTOOLTIP would still be needed).
- Fixed: Possible delay between sending packets required to display buy/sell menus.

09-01-2011, ShiryuX
- Added #1881: TAT_AS_FULL trigger type to TRIGGER function to set ARGO, ARGN and ARGS.
  Example: TRIGGER @MyTest,<def.TAT_AS_FULL>,01,100,200,300,here,start,my,args
           will call @MyTest with ARGO.UID=01, ARGN1=100, ARGN2=200, ARGN3=300
           and ARGS=here,start,my,args (this supports ARGV[].)

  trigger another tooltip resend if a monitored property changes during the resend.
- Fixed #1814: AutoResendTooltip setting not working when an item property is changed just
  before it is placed in a container (e.g. when the item amount changes during stacking).

10-01-2011, MrSugarCube
- Added #1872: Support for setting SPEEDMODE to 4, as handled by newer clients. This can be
  used to prevent a player from moving. Movement checks have been adjusted accordingly so
  whilst older clients won't understand this speed mode, Sphere will still block their
  movement attempts (with a slight 'rubber banding' effect as you'd normally get when freezing
  a player by other means).

11-01-2011, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1888: Exception caused by AutoTooltipResend attempting to send tooltips for deleted
  items.

21-01-2011, MrSugarCube

01-12-2013, XuN

02-12-2013, Khaos
-CHANGED: PERMITTEDUSE to CANUSE variable on chars and items. (This was done on the empty variables for help with the base packs
 and to allow more free change usage. Binding this internally would have left out customization for others).

03-12-2013, XuN

		When used on chars, cliloc 1116690 is used instead of the original 1050045 to preserve prefix and suffix
		
04-12-2013, XuN
-Added @ResourceGather for RegionResources and @RegionResourceGather for Players:
	This trigger is being fired just before gathering skill has finished (after all animations and timings)

13-12-2013, Khaos
-Added: EventsItem=e_youreventhere; was added to the sphere.ini and hard code. Functions as eventsplayers/pets/regions.
 This code fires on ALL items if something is in the global event and fires after tevents and before typedef. Don't overuse
 this. We found legitimacy in this addition with a few ideas it would be needed for.
-Changed: attr_nodrop and attr_notrade combined in one as Attr_NoDropTrade. Same with the two variables are now NODROPTRADE on items.
-Added: attr_artifact now takes the spot of attr_notrade

		These can be set on Items in game or in the ITEMDEF section. (They can be set on all items but only in use on archery types)
-Added: AMMOCONT to Items and ITEMDEF which can take the UID of a container (for specific container) or an ID (for a type of container)

15-12-2013, XuN
-Added: Spellflag_bless and Spellflag_curse for blessing spells like Agility, Blessing,etc and for Weaken,Curse, etc.
-Modified: sphere_defs.scp and sphere_spells.scp to add these spellflags.

15-12-2013, Khaos
-Added: BONUSHITSMAX, BONUSMANAMAX, BONUSSTAMMAX, and REGENFOOD variables to prepare for a huge overhaul of the internal overrides and status
 bar packet.
-Added: INCREASEDEFCHANCEMAX, RESPHYSICALMAX, RESFIREMAX, RESCOLDMAX, RESENERGYMAX, AND RESPOISONMAX variables for CHARACTERS ONLY. The
 new status bar packets checks for client >= 7.0.3. Full functional now with THOSE variables and those on it. Ones added earlier for the mis-
 informed information won't be leaving the servers since they might be for EC.
-Changed: PlayerStatusUpdate Packet now processes the variables it uses.

16-12-2013, Khaos (Script Pack)
-Changed: Changed colors_neutral range from { 1801 1887 } to { 1801 1908 } as noted on bugtracker.

22-12-2013, Ben
-Changed: LUCK, CURFOLLOWER, MAXFOLLOWER, and TITHING to work on all chars, not just players.
-Added: Support for local database (SQLite) through LDB. reference. (No External programs required!)
		-Syntax is similar to MySQL, but slightly different http://sqlite.org/lang.html
		-Functions are almost the same as DB. with a few changes.
			LDB.CONNECT "filename" to open a database file
			LDB.AEXECUTE and LDB.AQUERY are non existent
		-SQLite database manipulation program can be found here http://sqliteexpert.com/download.html

02-01-2014, Khaos (Script pack)
-Changed: This upload is containing the rework of multidef files with new naming conventions, price adjustments, etc. spheretables.scp
 has been updated to reflect loading of the multis folder. New syntax is m_* instead of i_multi_*.
-Added: Added variant versions of tents and evil compound with doors and signs. Wheat Cottage got doors and a sign as well.
-Added: sphere_defs_2.scp This will now be loaded after sphere_defs.scp containing any backwards compatibility I do.
-Fixed: Broken treasure multis should be fixed based on some old revisions I saw in an old script I had.
-Changed: Mordaunt sent me an updated housing system to match the new house and foundation defnames.
-TODO: Add in the new multidef info to deeds and vendors.
-Moved: spk_ship_cmds to speech folder.
-Fixed: New ships were using t_multi and not t_ship. I assume this might have been causing some of the alleged "bugs" with them. They
 are now all using t_ship.

03-01-2014, Ben
Fixed #2256: Reworked NPC object throwing..
->canseelos checks now applies to overrides
->changed tag.override.rock to NPC variable THROWOBJ (can take numerical or string ID now)
->changed tag.override.dam to NPC varialbe THROWDAM min,max (can also be "THROWDAM max" for non variating damage)
->added THROWRANGE min,max  (can also be "THROWRANGE max" with a min of 2 by default)
->All 3 variables are available on dynamic npc or in CHARDEF
Fixed: AMMOANIM,AMMOANIMHUE,AMMOANIMRENDER,AMMOCONT, and AMMOTYPE no able to be read directly from SERV.ITEMDEF...

04-01-2014, Ben
Fixed #1904: EF_WalkCheck causing some NPCs to climb impassable terrain.

05-01-2014, Ben
Added #1638: Defmessages are accessible with <DEFMSG.msg_name>
			->Also not documented but available before: Defmessages can be set with "DEFMSG.msg_name new_msg"

09-01-2014, RanXerox (Script pack)
-Fixed some duplicate itemdef and defnames

10-01-2014, XuN
Changed: MaxFood is now writable.
Added @TradeCreate trigger for chars, fired after trade windows are created:
	SRC=The other player.
	Argo=Item wich starts the trade.
	return 1 stops the trade.
Added @DropOn_Trade trigger for items:
	Act=item adding to trade window.
	Argo=Other player.
	return 1 blocks the placement.
Added @TradeClose trigger for chars, fired before a trade window is being closed (Opossed to @TradeAccepted).
	SRC=The char closing the trade window.
Fixed: Players can now open their containers while placed on trade windows (still cannot pickup items from them, nor them).
Change: Players used to be able to open the containers of other players while they were inside a trade window, these behaviour is now controled in sphere.ini.
Added: Ini option 'TradeWindowSnooping' to handle this behaviour: 0 will open the bags, 1 will call for snooping (or deny it by your scripts).
Notes:	-For now there's still a issue causing the client to crash while someone with a trade window open closes his client or just logs off.
		-invisible (hidden) players can open trade windows to another players (but only first player will see it, this behaviour will remain, it can be fixed with @TradeCreate).

11-01-2014, Ben
Fixed #2258: Some properties returning as hex instead of decimal.

12-01-2014, XuN
Change in @TradeClose:
	Src is the player closing the window.
	Argo is the other player.
Fixed: Items being able to move while inside a container inside a trade window.
Fixed: Containers on the ground not being able to open.
Changed: Ships work again in Lost Lands.
Fixed: Disconnect not working correctly with trysrv in high privileged characters.
Added: return 1 to f_onchar_create, it blocks the creation and disconnects the client.

13-01-2014, XuN
Removed: tag.override.noto.$uid, having one tag per 1 character viewing this is insane.
Added: @NotoSend, this trigger will override the default color for status bar and character 'mouse hovering' color (Replacement for tag.override.noto.$uid)
	src=The player viewing this char
	argn1=bar/char color (0 will let the default system run)
Note: The first 7 colors are the same as NOTO_* definitions, but you can use all your hues range (however the colors does not display like in items/chars)

15-01-2014, XuN
Fixed: Items being able to move inside containers placed in trade windows (semi-fixed before)
Fixed: Gold function now updates automatically the status bar.
Fixed: Move back the character data before f_onchar_create to be able to read it again.
Added: @SeeHidden trigger (Heavy load, keep it clean) fired when a char is going to see (or not) an invisible character (just like staff see other staff members while invisible)
	argn1=Invisible/Visible (but grayed out)
	No returns for this trigger.

17-01-2014, Ben
Fixed #2244: SERV.ACCOUNT UNUSED xxx can now take any functions with the account being the default in the function.

19-01-2014, Ben
-Added #1607: "LIST.XXX.SET args,..." This will clear the list and set each arguments (separated by a ,) as an element of the specified LIST
-Added: "LIST.XXX.APPEND args,..." This acts the same as SET, but will not clear the LIST. It will add to the LIST
-Change: String parsing should now respect commas(,) as a character inside double quotes ("") instead of treating it as a separator (for most places anyways)
		This allows situations like this:   LIST.XXX.SET value1,"value2,value3",value4  to have a result of:
		LIST.XXX.0 = value1
		LIST.XXX.1 = value2,value3
		LIST.XXX.2 = value4
-Added #1787,#2142: "LIST.XXX.SORT args"  This will re-order the the list using 'args' as order method.
		'No args' or 'asc' - sorts case sensitive ascending
		'i' or 'iasc' - sorts case insensitive ascending
		'desc' - sorts case sensitive descending
		'idesc' - sorts case insensitive descending

23-01-2014, XuN
Fixed #2257: Weapons now doesn't hit from Range+1
Added tag.override.SpellTimeout to alter default .ini setting to individual players.

25-01-2014, XuN
Added BUILD function to server, wich returns the svn's build number via <serv.build>, can be used on scripts to keep up versioning and stop the code or do different things between versions in example. (Ok, caught, Ben did it!)

25-01-2014, Script-Pack (Coruja)

-Fixed #2266: Trade Window memory not being removed.
-Change: LIST.xxx.FINDELEM args will now search as a string if 'args' is not a number regardless if it's inside double quotes "".

04-02-2014, XuN
Fixed #2273: Crafting skills with skf_craft not working like they should (Note: skf_scripted means the script is totally custom, for everything, so skf_craft won't work with skf_scripted).
Fixed #2267: Items in the cursor (layer_dragging) are now bounced if a target is opened to the player.

05-02-2014, XuN (Script Pack)
Fixed: changed back i_multi to the new m_ naming style in sphere_item_provisions_deed.scp.
Updated Mordaunt's House System to version 2.3.4.

09-02-2014, Ben
-Added: New variable TIMESTAMP to dynamic items and characters. (To allow for server time to upgrade to INT64)
-Moved: t_corpse.more1, t_book.more2, t_message.more2, t_eq_memory_obj.more2 to new TIMESTAMP
-Added: t_forest and t_jungle to sphere_defs.scp to fix ISNEARTYPE problems
-Fixed: <SERV.BUILD> returning date instead of revision number even though revision number is available.
-Changed: Most Interger types to INT64 for higher time support. Tags and Vars also can hold 64bit numbers. This fixes #1447

13-02-2014, XuN
Fixed: Players now become instantly GuildMasters when placing a Guild Stone instead of waiting until first DClick.
Added functionality to the ATTR_LOCKEDDOWN and ATTR_SECURED flags: locked down items should not be able to be moved, decay and be eaten by npcs (and some more default behaviour), secured items have all this checks but not the ones related to pick up and use.

Script Pack:
Modified: Iron ore now requires 0.0 Mining instead of 20.0.
Updated: New update of Mordaunt's house system.
Updated sphere_msgs.scp: Added ITEMUSE_SECURED, ITEMUSE_SECURE_ON and ITEMUSE_SECURE_OFF

15-02-2014, Ben
-Fixed #2275: NPCs walking through multi doors
-Fixed: Targets not removing when using SELF and LAST

16-02-2014, XuN
Modified @StatChange: now is working properly in EVERY stat change, and not only in the stat gain/loses
	argn1=statid (maxhits,maxmana,maxstam and maxfood are checked now too)
	argn2=the current stat value
	argn3=the new value
Fixed some new variables not working.

ScriptPack:
updated sphere_events_npcs.scp: Functions ModMaxHits/Stam/Mana to work better, they also accept += and the rest of operators.
added: sphere_attr.rar to Custom folder containing some basic behaviour for attr_secure and attr_nodroptrade (for now).
Updated Mordaunt's house system to version 2.3.7

16-02-2014, Ben
-Added #2270: summoned tag added to summoned creatures if CHARTAGS=1 in sphere.ini
Script Pack:
Corrected some defnames - i_fruit_cantelope -> i_fruit_canteloupe
 i_fruit_gourd1 -> i_fruit_gourd_yellow
 i_fruit_gourd2 -> i_fruit_gourd_green

17-02-2014, XuN
Added targetcancel function to force closing a target. 
Fixed some new variables returning hex values. 
Added functionality to RegenHits/Mana/Stam, they use the current tag.override.regen_x values 

Moved all @SkillChange triggers to CChar::Skill_SetBase, now every skill change is calling this trigger (as it should), no matter of .skill_name, .allskills, skillgains/loses and skill trains.
Fixed serv.Regenx returning value*10

18-02-2014, XuN
Regeneration Tweaks: 
	-Moved up a check to force stop in this stat, so useless checks are avoided in a function fired in each tick (each lil improve is a win!).
	-Added FOOD as a regen stat (RegenFood or tag.override.regen_3)
	-ADDED RegenValStat variables (RegenValHits, etc) to work as the RegenStat variables but with tag.override.regenval_x.
	-Removed @Hunger
	-Removed weird check that multiplied the regen time *2 if the stat was not food, it now works with the time specified in sphere.ini
	-Removed weird "Bonus" in HITS giving more delay than the default one, it should sustract it to be a real bonus? however, timers are handled in the trigger now and following the default ini settings.
	-Removed tag.override.regen(val)_x: RegenValStat is now readed inside @RegenStat and RegenStat is readed before it, cannot be modified inside without the trigger bein fired in each serv.tick. RegenStat overrides ini setting now (wich is more intuitive when scripting)
	-Added @RegenStat trigger fired after
		-local.StatID=(0=Hits,1=Mana,2=Stam,3=Food). Writable, never higher than 3.
		-local.Value=The amount of points being regenerated (or decreased in food's case). Writable, can be negative but 0 works like return 1
		-local.StatLimit=by default=<MaxStat>, allow this stat to pass the limit when regenerating, or limit it lower. Stats over this value will go down in each tick until they reach their limit. This does not work with food as food shouldn't ignore its limit (0).
		-return 1 Stop de regeneration of this stat, but not preventing future checks, to do that set the RegenHits to a very high value.
		
Added f_onaccount_connect to sphere_serv_triggers.scp, READ IT CAREFULLY, I switched the default return procedure here for safety, return 1 will allow the account connecting no matter you have checks or not.
Added LowerReq to the ReqSTR check when trying to equip items for both items and chars (It checks for LowerReqs on the item and in the character too to substract to the real ReqSTR)

23-02-2014, XuN
-Modified: CanUse is now only an item property, it also returns now values in hex format to work with it as a flag variable. 
-Sphere.ini: Added the maps 2-5 but commented out, added a few missing comments in some flags. 
-Added a check to IsTrigUsed to avoid trigger calls while serv is loading, this will improve load times and avoid several unexpected errors. 
-Removed SKTRIG_STROKE's checks from skills and moved to a new function to keep together all the checks giving more control to skills.
-Added skill_stroke() wich handles the strokes left and sound for craft and gathering skills and also a new trigger.
-Fixed amount of strokes to each crafting skill, they were random, now they have 2 strokes by default.
-Added @SkillStroke trigger:
        Local.Skill=Skill ID. (Read only).
        Local.strokes=Strokes left*     (Read/Write).
        Local.Sound=Sound to make in this stroke if any (Read/Write).
        Local.Delay=Delay until next stroke (10 = 1 second).
        return 1 Abort the skill.
        return 2* Abort the consumption of resources in this stroke.
 
        *Alchemy works different so its working with some exceptions:
                -Local.Strokes instead of going down it's going up until it reach the total strokes count, wich are equal to the amount of resources. In each stroke if no return is given resources are consumed.
                return 2 Its only allowed in alchemy skill, returning this will let the skill continue to next step (stroke, finish...) without consuming anything in this stroke.
-Modified @SkillStart: Local.CraftStrokeCnt is NOT writable for alchemy, since the skill works different and cannot be overriden this way, use @SkillStroke to add more Strokes if you want.
-Fixed #2267: MakeItem function now bounces any item in layer_dragging.
-Moved some new variables to return decimal numbers instead of strings.

23-02-2014, Mordaunt (Script Pack): 
Another update to sphere_item_provisions_deed.scp, adding new ships and moving their names to m_ too.

24-02-2014, XuN
-Fixed #2267: MakeItem function now bounces any item in layer_dragging. 

25-02-2014, XuN
Actual crafting skills (Blacksmithing, Tailoring...) now are not handled as crafting skills by the source, instead of that a SKF_CRAFT is required in their [Skill ] (Excepting Alchemy by the moment)
WARNING: From this version a update of sphere_skills is needed (read below) or crafting skills will not work.
Script pack:
	-sphere_skills.scp: Added FLAGS=SKF_CRAFT to blacksmithing,tailoring,tinkering,carpentry, cooking, bowcraft and inscription.

02-03-2014, Ben
-Fixed #2261: (script pack) Hairs/beards using wrong names (multiple scripts updated for this)

03-03-2014, XuN
Added local.Anim to @SkillStroke trigger.
Fixed wrong animations sent in each Stroke (Some are missing?).

14-03-2014, XuN
Fixed #2289:
-Added local.HitsHungerLoss for StatID 3 (Food) in the @RegenStat trigger, this value is still a percentaje and NOT the hitpoints to lose, but setting it to 0 will disable the loss of hitpoints for this character.
-Update: Damage received via Hunger have flags DAM_GOD|DAM_GENERAL|DAM_NOUNPARALYZE, if you want to change it just set Local.HitsHungerLoss to 0 and create your own damage there.

15-03-2014, Xun & Ben
Added support for packet 0xE2 (NewPacketAnimation), wich involves on updating some animations to a new packet and fixes most of the bugs on the gargoyles animations
(Throwing still needs some more updates to see the weapons coming back).

16-03-2014, Ben
Fixed #2285: FVAL returning wrong values in linux.

17-03-2014, XuN
Added @StatChange to ModStr/dex/int/food.

21-03-2014, Ben
Changed: Character creation to process 4th skill properly
Removed: EXTRASKILL.KEY and EXTRASKILL.VAL from f_onchar_create as they are being properly processed.

23-03-2014, matex
1. Fixed a crashbug in the nighly build.
2. @StatChange now receives argn1 for changes like:
0=OStr, 1=OInt, 2=ODex, 3=Food, 4=MaxHits, 5=MaxMana, 6=MaxStam, 7=MaxFood, 8=ModStr, 9=ModInt, 10=ModDex.

24-03-2014, matex
Fixed a calculation bug in Linux that e.g. had influence on Skilldelays

25-03-2014, matex
1. Fixed INT64 Expression handling.
2. Fixed a bug that occured when DIALOGCLOSE/DIALOG was sent to older clients
3. Fixed a minor bug in @StatChange

26-03-2014, matex
1. Fixed Cooking

26-03-2014, matex
1. Fixed a bug in ASC and ASCPAD with negative hex values
2. Fixed StatChange triggering for Food
3. Fixed a bug in the movement code, when climbing stairs with (BRIDGE|PLATFORM flags)
4. Updating logged out characters does'nt send a packet unless ALLSHOW is on

28-03-2014, Ben
Fixed #2296: Quality property not working.

28-03-2014, matex
1. Some internal values are still stored as 32bit (e.g. MORE1, ...). If they are negative their value
is now given as 64bit hex number so calculations,comparisions etc.. work on these values now.
2. Fixed an issue with MaxFood/Food. If MaxFood is set to 0, when read it will return the MaxFood level
of the chardefinition
3. Fixed: The server now only loads 1 Map, if you only use 1 Map.
4. Fixed: NPCs moving over obstacles when EF_WALKCHECK is disabled

29-03-2014, Ben
1. Uptaded Sphere.ini description for MAPx settings (These are now mandatory as of revision 1834)
2. Created an exception for MAP0 to load automatically even if not specified in sphere.ini (need at least 1 map to load)
3. Fixed another instance of 64 bit handling.
   (Script pack)
4. Fixed #2292: small change in teleport points for sphere_map_points0.scp and sphere_map_points1.scp
5. #2301 Few flag and typo changes done to sphere_map(2,3,5).scp

30-03-2014, Ben
Fixed system tray icon not removing on exit.

02-04-2014, matex
1. Introduced EF_NoContextMenuLOS => Will disable LOS checks for ContextMenu Use of npcs
2. Improved the standard Walkcheck stuff a bit (especially when dealing with landtiles)
3. Improved the placement code when items are dropped to ground
4. Increased standard LOS Zcheck treshold to 20
5. Changed the meaning of MOVERATE and TAG.OVERRIDE.MOVERATE. It is now a factor that scales the amount of DEX value 
   that should be taken into consideration for walking speed. E.g. if you only want 75% of the characters DEX value
   to be used in walkspeed calculations, you specify MOVERATE=75. Setting this to 100 has no effect.
6. Fixed: Backpack closing when items are dropped to corpse. (You can softscript this if you need it!)
7. Fixed: Use 1-Unit comparisons in Distance Checking. We can't use the axiom of pythagoras here because one tile has
   the same diagonal width as vertical and horizontal width. Doing real-world distance checkings messes up everything here!

08-04-2014, matex
1. Fixed HitsHungerloss. 
2. Modified behaviour of DiagonalWalkChecks when dclicking items in reach
3. If GM's add players to a party, the player is now added forcibly.
4. Fixed a possible itemleak when dropping too many items to the ground. (e.g. via newitem)
5. Fixed a null reference exception when DISPID of an item is set to something that wasnt defined via ITEMDEF. (e.g. change an item via set dispid)
6. Fixed an exception when you type 'c' in the serverconsole and have more than 100 players online ;)
7. Fixed a possible crash bug when players disconnect. Fixed players not logging out sometimes too. (this did only occur on VERY rare circumstances)

09-04-2014, XuN
-Added f_onaccount_pwchange to sphere_serv_triggers.scp
-Modified f_onaccount_create.
Both are fire now in each account creation / password change, no matter the source (serv.account xx ingame, via console, .set password...).

13-04-2014, Feeh
Fixed #2306: No lag should be noticeable after f_onserver_save call
Fixed #2293: Sphere should now read packets correctly from 6.0.1.7 clients

14/15/16-04-2014, Coruja (Script Pack)

-Added: missing regions for some islands 
-Fixed: incorrect GROUP set on Fire Temple, Ice Isle 
-Fixed: incorrect FLAGS set on Moonglow Zoo, Jail, Green Acres, shrine regions

sphere_map_points0.scp: 
-Fixed: Delucia Passage teleporting to incorrect position 

sphere_map_points1.scp:
-Updated to match changes of previous sphere_map_points0.scp commit 

sphere_map0_ml.scp: 
-Moved: temp moved all SE/ML/HS regions to this file. Since it have only a few regions, maybe it's better disband this file and move all regions to their correct map file (map0, map3 and map4) 
sphere_map4.scp: 
-Small update on Tokuno Islands regions 

sphere_newb.scp: 
-Updated all skill to match OSI default starting items and colors. 
PS: Still need a few more additional items for professions (Warrior, Necromancer, Paladin, Samurai, Ninja) -> I can't update this for now, sphere only have support to skills on sphere_newb.scp,
	 but not for professions (it would be great if someone give a little help with this on the source :D) 

17-04-2014, XuN
Moved tag.override.SpellTimeOut to SpellTimeOut.
Changed: Now @Create trigger can be fired on EVENTS too. Note: be aware of the calls order (SkillClass -> added events -> ini -> chardef (for chars)),
		you can't retrieve the <str> ie in a custom event because it's fired before the @Create in the CHARDEF (which is the one setting it), this trigger
		doesn't have return 1 so if you set str=15 in your event it will be overwrited with the stat given in the chardef.

Changed all the variables in the 'New Variables' thread to make them readable not only from items/chars but from their BaseDef. That means, no need of IncreaseSwingSpeed
		under the @Create, you can set them like the NAME property. Added some variables too, read the post.

Script Pack:
Updated some scripts to reflect the variable's changes:
		-items/sphere_item_artifacts.scp
		-items/sphere_item_artifacts_minor.scp
		-items/sphere_item_artifacts_tokuno.scp
		-items/sphere_item_magic_jewelry.scp
		-items/sphere_item_provisions_armor.scp
		-items/sphere_item_provisions_clothing.scp
		-items/sphere_item_provisions_jewelry.scp
		-items/sphere_item_provisions_shields.scp
		-items/sphere_item_resources.scp
		-items/sphere_item_typedef_equipitem.scp
		-npcs/sphere_monsters.scp
		-npcs/sphere_monsters_custom.scp

sphere_item_vegetation.scp: Commented out TDATA3=i_vanilla_bean since it does not exist.

sphere_item_provisions_deeds.scp:
		-Fixed line 64: RESOURCES=i_deed,m_stone_and_plaster_house.
		-Changed all of the remaining i_multi_foundation_* to m_foundation_*.

sphere_item_provisions_armor.scp: changed all i_leather from gargoyle leather armor to i_hides_cut (lines 4704 - 5000).

For a complete change's track visit http://scripts.spherecommunity.net/

18-04-2014, XuN
-Fixed a Typo in sphere_item_typedef_equipitem.scp (SeldRepair -> SelfRepair)
-Updated sphere_monsters.scp to add stats to c_tiger and changed changed actual c_tiger to c_tigress
-Added item 03ec7 to sphere_item_ship_parts.scp to link it with c_tiger
-Updated sphere_defs.scp to reflect c_tiger and c_tigress as mounts.

19-04-2014, Ben
Changed: CANUSE flags can now be properly set on ITEMDEF and dynamic items (ITEMDEFs value is given to dynamic items on creation)
Fixed 1565: Removed TAG.OVERRIDE.RANGE from items and chars.
			Changed RANGE so it can be read/write on items and char (Dynamic object value overrides basedef value. Highest value between weapon and char is used in combat)
			RANGEH and RANGEL are also available as readonly variables for dynamic items and char now
			Added FIGHTRANGE to chars to replace old RANGE (readonly and returns the highest value used for combat)

19-04-2014, XuN
-Fixed 0002310: Changed t_weapon_bow in Throwing Items (sphere_item_provisions_weapons.scp) to t_weapon_throwing.
-Fixed 0002309: Mounted characters (humans & elfs) are not sending New Animation packet anymore.
-Fixed 0002294: Every CAN-related property (dye, enchant, flip...) is now working in base items instead of inheriting from DispID.
-Some internal changes related to IsHuman: changed it to IsPlayableCharacter and splitted it into IsHuman || IsElf || IsGargoyle and changed its calls.
	-Same for IsHumanID -> IsPlayableID = (IsHumanID || IsElfID || IsGargoyleID)
	-Fixed: Gargoyles are no longer able to ride anything.

Fixed #2014: memory_aggreived not being set on players
Fixed #2311: t_light_lit not decaying as normal

23-04-2014, Ben
Fixed #1500: Quote causing problems for ARGS and ARGV. This is how is will work now in a simple function called TEST...
	-.TEST "a", b, "c,d"		Output: ARGS = a	ARGV[0] = a	ARGV[1] = b	ARGV[2] = c,d
	-.TEST "a"e, b, "c,d"		Output: ARGS = a	ARGV[0] = a	ARGV[1] = b	ARGV[2] = c,d
	-.TEST e"a", b, "c,d"f		Output: ARGS = e"a", b, "c,d"f	ARGV[0] = e"a"	ARGV[1] = b	ARGV[2] = c,d
	-.TEST f"a"g"h,i",b,e"c,d"	Output: ARGS = f"a"g"h,i",b,e"c,d"	ARGV[0] = f"a"g"h,i"	ARGV[1] = b	ARGV[2] = e"c,d"
	*All ARGV will now show even if quotes are found in first argument.
	*if quotes are found as the first character of an argument, what is found in the quote is the argument
	*if a quote is found but not at the beginning, or no quote is found, whole string is used as argument.

24-04-2014, Ben
Fixed #1739: ">" in QVAL's condition is now processed properly as "bigger than" instead of the end of QVAL

26-04-2014, Ben
Changed: TAG.OVERRIDE.DOORSOUND_CLOSE for DOORCLOSESOUND
		TAG.OVERRIDE.DOORSOUND_OPEN for DOOROPENSOUND
		TAG.OVERRIDE.PORTCULISSOUND for PORTCULISSOUND
Added: DOOROPENID to Items for new door system.
Fixed #2054: Should now be able to make any door work with new scripting options (default still works if no new data is found)
	-Game Item: (if no info here, use ITEMDEF info)
		-DOOROPENID=0676 //ID to change into (no DEFNAME as it's only used for dispid)
		-MOREX=-1 // X position change
		-MOREY=1  // Y position change
		-DOORCLOSESOUND=00f3 closing sound
		-DOOROPENSOUND=00eb opening sound
	-ITEMDEF: (if no info here and on game item, use default system)
		-TDATA1=00eb00f3 //WORD open | WORD close (sounds)
		-TDATA2=0676 //ID to change into (no DEFNAME as it's only used for dispid)
		-TDATA3=-1 // X position change
		-TDATA4=1  // Y position change

29-04-2014, Ben
-Fixed: VAR,TAG and LOCAL causing instability in the server with huge amount of data. Limit of 2048 caracters has been set.

30-04-2014, XuN
-Added SpellCount function for Spellbooks (Read Only).
-Tweaked Attacker system:
	Added attacker.add uid / attacker.delete uid. Self explanatory
	Changed: attacker.elapsed/dam are now writable

02-05-2014, XuN
Updated house deeds in sphere_template_vend.scp (Thx azmanomer).
Fixed: local.anim in @SkillStroke was readable but not writable. Fixed also alchemy skill sending anim 0 instead of no anim.
Rewrote totally the combat system for npcs ( I may have missed something but it's mostly done ):
	memory_war_targ is no longer used for npc combats (in the source) but is still present for scripting backwards, Sphere now uses the 'Attacker' system and a new variable added to it 'Threat'.
	added @CombatStart, @CombatEnd, @CombatAdd triggers, return 1 stops actions. (not recomendable, the actions will be called over and over obviously trying to start/add or end the combat).
	Attacker system (Added/Changed):
					NPC_AI_THREAT flag variable to ini enabling the use of the threat variable for choosing targets in combat (for npcs).
		General:	Attacker.add uid	(Write)		Adds the given UID as new enemy in the attacker list for this char.
					Attacker.Delete uid	(Write)		Remove UID from the attacker list.
					Attacker.Target		(Read)		Returns the current best target, these are the priorities: Threat -> Distance -> LOS.
					Attacker.ID uid		(Read)		Returns the 'n' id of the given uid (if in the attacker list, returns -1 if not).
		From ID:	Attacker.n.Threat 	(Read/Write)Gets or Sets the Threat of this character against me, Threat is most important factor to select a target. (this gets updated even if npc_ai_threat is disabled, but its not used)
					Attacker.n.Dam 		(Read/Write)Made it writable.
					Attacker.n.Elapsed	(Read/Write)Made it writable.
I'm updating the wiki with this new information also.

03-05-2014, Ben
-Fixed #2325: Corpse with morez > 0 were able to be draged
-Fixed #1781: Rejected moves should not count as a move for fast walk detection.

06-05-2014, Feeh
-Modified #2328: Dye tub now call @Dye on the dyed item
	ARGN1		= the hue value (r/w)
	ARGN2		= sound effect (r/w) (default 023e)
	ARGO		= the item that originated the dye target
	SRC			= who is dying the item 
	RETURN 1	= stop internal dying/sound. hue changes made from script will take place
	This will allow to change Dye behaviour for specific items without having to track the item id from other methods/scripts
	
07-05-2014, XuN
-Updated 'guards' defname in sphere_defs.scp, guards have other ID since long time ago.
-Added exception lines to the new Attacker_* functions so if something goes wrong... errors are more descriptive. Also fixed some exceptions appearing now.
-Attacker.elapsed -1 means no attacker decay.
-Fixed #2332: Range, also RangeL/RangeH not working as it should after the variables changes. Also made them return in decimal values instead of hexadecimal.
-Made BloodColor writable.
-Modified Guards system:
	Modified @CallGuards trigger for players calling separatelly than NPCs.
	This trigger will fire one time on the Player calling guards per each possible target, argn3 is set to 1 if the target is hostile, however if set to 0 nothing will happen, if this is set to 1 the character will be attacked by guards.
-Fixed guards dissapearing after calling them. They also stick now to the attacker system (if defined) being easier to create custom guards (changing how and when are they called will come in next commits)
-Added ini setting GuardsOnMurderers (1 by default), if set to 0 will only attack criminals, if set to 1 will attack criminals and murderers.
-Fixed: GuardsInstantKill now set hits to 1 before hit to ensure the kill, it was acting as instant hit instead of instant kill
-Changed: Moved the instant kill ouside the 'teleport' check, to ensure its using it everytime and not only if target.distance > 1
-Switched 2 checks to ensure that guards are not called on guards.
-Added a check in OnNoticeCrime() to avoid guards becoming criminals if send to attack any good character.

08-05-2014, XuN
Changed @Criminal trigger, now it's being called in every criminal call instead of in OnNoticeCrime(), return 1 prevents the criminal action, argn1 is how many time will the criminal status last.
Fixed CanUse returning weird values when ITEMDEF didn't have any value.
Added WeightReduction to item's weight calculations, so a item with 5.0 weight and 10 Weight Reduction will result in 4.5 weight stones.

09-05-2014, XuN
-Fixed an exception when attacking blue characters.
-Created a new vector-list to handle Notoriety: instead of having 2-5+ checks per second (and nearby character), the notoriety will be saved in this list to reduce a lot the loading related to this function.
-Added NotoTimeout to ini (default 30) to set the 'decay' for notoriety in each character for another one. However the list will be reseted in each criminal/murderer action/karma change/incognito cast.
-Fixed some Karma messages being shown even if the trigger returned 1. Fixed #2297: Trigger's returns were working wrong and any value given to argn1 was not really being considered by sphere unless return != 0.
-Fixed #2290: Now crafting skills cast animations and sounds when starting and in every Skill_Stroke > 1 (1 is the last, note that skill_stroke is called before the stroke ends, not before starting it).
-Removed SKF_NOANIM check after the @SKillStroke trigger, so even if the skill have this flag, it won't pass any value to local.anim, but if you want to have animation for a specific character, then you can write it.

09-05-2014, Ben
-Improved how RangeH/L 'fix' work and making them readable by dynamic items in every situation.

09-05-2014, Feeh
-Fixed #2326: Some mt_* CAN flags were not allowed to be assigned after char/npc creation. It should be assignable anytime from now

10-05-2014, XuN
Fixed #2334. Also forced that any character called to be a guard ( Argn1 in @CallGuards ) have brain_guard no matter what it is really.
Fixed #2333. Also fixing @Attack trigger blocking any other actions too when returning 1.
Added #1765 :New ini setting: AttackingIsaCrime making criminal any character without any damage, only attacking.

10-05-2014, Feeh (thanks to Ben)
Modified: @Dye is now called on more situations on both Items and Chars:
	-Script color changes					(SRC/ARGO = Server)
	-Dye tubs (t_dye_vat) color changes		
	-@Create color assignment				(SRC/ARGO = Server)
	-Staff .xcolor command					(SRC/ARGO = Server)

22-05-2014, Ben
Changed: char's AGE property now returns in days instead of seconds (CREATE is already in seconds)

23-05-2014, Feeh
Changed: Harvesting skills (Fishing/Mining/Lumberjacking) can now pack or place the harvested resource at feet
	Override ACTARG2 on either @SkillSuccess and @Success (remember that @SkillSuccess is called first)
	ACTARG2 = 0 -> Put the resource at feet
	ACTARG2 = 1 -> Pack the resource

26-05-2014, Ben
Removed and made permanent EF_FixKillTrigger, EF_WalkCheck, EF_NewPositionCheck, and EF_DiagonalWalkCheck

26-05-2014, matex
Fixed a small bug in the code that adds a player forcibly when GM's add to party.

27-05-2014, XuN
Changed: new order for @Create trigger in items, now the order is this; Itemdef, @ItemCreate for characters ( if proceed ), TEvents, EventsItem and Typedef
Fixed #2350: Guards working in non-guarded areas when GuardsOnMurderes=1
Fixed #2352: AttackingIsACrime checks making criminal when it shouldn't
Fixed #2351: Murderers never becoming criminal (didn't need before GuardsOnMurderers).
Fixed #2353: Wrong speech color for tillerman.
Fixed #2349. Also improved the Attacker_GetID() functions a bit.
Fixed #1491: region_flag_no_pvp not working fine. Also a wrong SkillUseQuick(tactics) related to it.
Added a new function to removed chars so they are being removed from attacker list's characters of their attacker's list. There's no reason to keep a not existing character.
Added ContextMenuLimit option to sphere.ini defining the maximum amount of options in each menu.

29-05-2014, XuN
Combat target for players will be 'reseted' after attacking a character, instead of checking for the best target ... so it now gives priority to player's choices.
Changed attacker.target also to reflect the changes and return the direct value instead of calling Fight_FindBestTarget().
Changed the way t_spawn_char creates the characters, they are now placed and the spawnitem is asigned before calling NPC_LoadScript() so, both spawn and regions can be read in the @Create (this can simulate a @CharCreate for spawns but on the character instead of the item.)
Changed summon to be placed also before the @Create.

01-16-2014, XuN
Changed @Attack: added Argn1 for npcs to allow modifying the initial 'Threat'.
Changed: Pets forced to attack (kill and attack commands) now adds 1000( plus the actual highest threat amount) to argn1 in the @Attack trigger.
Changed: Pets changes target instantly when attack is called always if NPC_AI_THREAT is off.
Updated sphere_defs_2.scp with m_keep.

06-06-2014, Feeh
Added: #2340 Sectors now do have flags, look at sphere_defs.scp for more info
Fixed: #2360
Fixed: BADSPAWN command was not stopping when the first bad spawn was found

11-06-2014, Ben
Added #2359: REGEN in REGIONRESOURCE can now have a range as argument.
Fixed #1827: Axis strip now works as case insensitive.
Fixed #2307: REGION_FLAG_INSTA_LOGOUT will now work in ROOMDEFs

23-06-2014, Feeh
Fixed #2366
Added: SERV.FUNCTIONS.x, it can display every available function and its access plevel
		Usage:
		SERV.FUNCTIONS.COUNT		- Return how many functions are available in your server
		SERV.FUNCTIONS.32			- Return the 33th function (zero-based)
		SERV.FUNCTIONS.32.PLEVEL	- Return the minimum access plevel to use this function
		SERV.FUNCTIONS.add1			- Return the minimum access plevel to use 'add1' function

1-07-2014, Ben
Updated: spherecrypt.ini with client 7.0.35
Changed: gold will now be taken from pack first and then from bank in a purchase
Fixed #2370: Not being able to walk up some stairs AGAIN!
Fixed #2371: Vendor buy/sell dialogs will now display in the same order as their templates

08-07-2014, XuN
Fixed, Updated and Improved the .dupe on both items and characters:
	- Added new variable's copy for both items and chars.
	- Duping characters now works fine: Stats, Skills, Tags, Items is copied now, by default every copied item have attr |= attr_newbie for security, using .dupe 1 will copy the items 'as they are' without mods.
	- Using .dupe 0 will create the mount's memory (if any) empty, so when npc dies... no mount appears, .dupe 1 will create another new duped mount character.

12-07-2014, Ben
Fixed #2372: Weightreduction causing errors when calculating weight.
Fixed a small issue with updating amount on items.

17-07-2014, XuN
Fixed #2345: Wrong titles for Elder/Legendary Bushido and Ninjitsu skills, updated sphere_msgs.scp.
Readjusted the skill ranges for skill titles according to http://www.uoguide.com/Skill_Title .
Added SKILL_TITLES to sphere_defs.scp to adjust the range for the skill's titles.

19-07-2014, XuN
SKF_GATHER enabled, only fishing will have this flag in sphere_skills.scp, so now @Stroke and @SkillStroke can be used.
@(Skill)Start and @(Skill)Stroke now use ACT as a reference for the worldgem.
@(Skill)Start have local.GatherStrokeCnt ONLY for gathering skills.
Fishing delay is now 8.0 (1 stroke), the splash animation is softcoded in sphere_skills.scp since working with timerf in the source will complicate things a little.
In the 'long and not even started' proccess of softcoding skills ... the sounds/animations (for fishing!) will be added in the skill's triggers.
Return 1 in @Stroke will fire @Abort.
Added RANGE for gathering skills determining the max distance for the proccess (added RANGE=4 for fishing in sphere_skills.scp)

22-07-2014, XuN
Removed default sysmessage when reading / writing Experimental and Option Flags directly ingame or from script.
SKF_GATHER is a generic flag now: Skills with this flag will automatically call for @Stroke and override default behaviour (no more calls to STAGE == SKTRIG_STROKE in the skill's function).
Added Range and SKF_GATHER to mining and lumberjacking, softcoded some code related to SKILL_STROKES of them (and fishing also) in sphere_skills.scp.

02-08-2014, XuN
Changed tag.override.breath.dam to Breath.Dam
Added Breath.Hue overriding the default explosion color for breaths.
Added @PartyLeave: return 1 stops the action
Modified Dir function, <DIR <src>> will return the dir you should have to face <src> (Same as FACE <SRC> but not turning you, just returning the DIR value).
Added Reveal (flags): Reveal statf_hidden will reveal player if has statf_hidden, same for sleeping, insubstantial and invisible. 
	Sum this flags to reveal more than 1 invis state (ie: statf_invisible|statf_sleeping will reveal player if any of these flags is present on him).
	Reveal -1 will reveal everything (Even invis staff).

Changed: SpellFlag_NoUnparalyze flag in s_explosion will affect explosion potions.
Changed: Argo is now writable ( Remember that Argo can only be accessed via script and not ingame ).
Added SysMessagef function accepting text with strings and limited to 3 args. Example: sysmessagef "Hello %s, I have a %s and %s, be aware of me!",<src.name>,<findlayer.1.name>,<findlayer.2.name>
	It needs the text to be inside " " to create the first arg with it, but first and last quotes will be removed (only these 2).
Changed: SkillUseQuick is now RW and not only Read because not always need a return.
SpellEffect ( CChar::Spell_Effect_Create() ) now set as NEW the UID of the spell's rune, IE: 'spelleffect s_poison,2000,<src>' ... 'new.remove ' will remove the poison rune.
Added @(item)MemoryEquip firing when equiping any item in memory layers (Not normal @Equip-able items), in example: paralyze rune, criminal memory ...
	argn1 = layer on which the item will be equiped.
	return 1 deletes the item and prevents default actions.
Fixed 'Range' not being properly defaulted to skill's defaults when no value is in the skill.
Fixed SKF_GATHER skills going to negative values when local.gatherstrokecnt=1.

Added SKF_FIGHT to fighting skills in sphere_skills.scp.
Fixed ADV_RATEs for parrying being too high and causing the skill to not gain.

Minor changes to 0x20 packet.

Modified ResPhysical to work like armor.lo. Modified Armor to be writable (only for items) and also Dam (for items and chars) and changed them from BYTE to WORD.
Moved Weight to dynamic items too.
Fixed bad definition of t_stone_town type in the f_stonesys_gettypename function inside sphere_genericstone_functions, should be <DEF.STONECONFIG_TYPENAME_TOWN>.
Added ColorInvis, ColorHidden and ColorInvisSpell to sphere.ini overriding (if specified) the default color for .invis, hidding or the invis spell/potion.

Fixed items remaining on the ground on Enhanced Client when equipping them via double click.
Fixed PacketMapChange being fired when DClicking an item and turning around (without OF_DClickNoTurn enabled). This should decrease the amount of rubberband effects.

NOTE: The following changes are supossed to be usefull to redo the default combat system, but not using the new trigger will make the new script and the following code useless so this is not forced,
	just a help to rewrite the actual sys without doing a whole new combat system allowing to tweak each check.
NOTE2: These changes are in 'beta' proccess, please report any problem to bugtracker.
NOTE3: If I was not clear enough... this makes no difference with current systems if the new trigger and dam_flag are not used.

Added DAM_FIXED to sphere_defs.scp: this flag will make sphere asume that the argn1 value in @gethit is the final damage and will not do any formula calculations over it,
	will only cast sounds,animations, blood, memories, attacker.n.% update and @GetHit trigger.
	It also have some effects in the hit proccess (explained under).
Changed: combat functions (hit & gethit ) to allow easy override via script with DAM_FIXED giving a better way to override the default combat system while knowing also the resulting damage
Added sphere_combat.scp with the override of the default combat system and explanations of the new changes also.
Added Swing Types in sphere_defs.scp for combat compatibility.
	//  SWING_INVALID = target is invalid, searching another one.
	//  SWING_EQUIPPING = swing made.
	//  SWING_READY = can't take my swing right now. but i'm ready
	//  SWING_SWINGING = taking my swing now.
Added Swing variable for characters setting or retrieving the SWING_TYPE they currently have.
Added FullTrigger function working like 'call' to call triggers with full support with old args and locals making possible to override default triggers with your parameters.
	FullTrigger must be write only to avoid some problems so I added the return value in local.return, which can be readed after the trigger call.
	Usage: FullTrigger @DClick
Added @HitCheck trigger just in the beggining of the hit allowing to use only custom combat checks (default ones are in the supplied script) or to override the whole combat formulas.
	- Args
		Argn1 = SWING_TYPE. Swing will be set to this value after the trigger so you can 'jump' between swings with or without default checks.
		Argn2 = DAM_FLAGS
	- Returns
		return -1 SWING_INVALID
		return 0 default checks
		return 1 will make Sphere return the SWING_TYPE applied in argn1, so if you are in SWING_SWINGING and you set argn1 to SWING_EQUIPPING you'll have to start the hit proccess again.
				(Note, argn1 there will NOT set SWING to it's value).
	- Special returns will be fired when SWING_TYPE = SWING_SWINGING & FLAGS & DAM_FIXED
		return 0 will generate the default damage formula and flags (if not set via argn2) and then call the gethit function without DAM_FIXED applied.
		return 2 will finish the hit function AS IT IS and will NOT call the gethit function (this asume you are creating the damage, formulas and calling .damage function).
Note: Using new DAM_FIXED or return 1, -1 will obviously NOT call any skillgain, memory change, exp, attacker update, notoriety, actions, etc. Using this will (almost) make you to rewrite the whole system as shown in the given script.

03-08-2014, XuN
Modified Dir and Face functions (and the not soft-coded functions) to prevent loading all items in each dir change, even if they were not send to clients they were consuming resources in the serve

04-08-2014, Ben
Fixed #2362: Old attacker code interfering with new code.
Added: BREAK and CONTINUE to script loops. (CONTINUE will skip to the next iteration, BREAK will exit the loop)

06-08-2014, XuN
Fixed a problem causing Staff with gm body (03db) to stick with this corpse and blocking following commands because of the '=' automatically appearing, Update is called when setting the body value.
Added party.create msg,uid(s) where msg is 0/1 sending default sysmessages or not (usefull when forcing groups 0 = disable ), the following args (up to 9 more) is/are the players to add to this party.
Changed all party triggers (Except the @PartyRemove when argn1=1, which means informative remove when a @PartyDisband has been fired before and is in proccess now) returnable to stop their following code.
Fixed crash bug introduced in last patch.

08-08-2014, XuN
Multiples items overplaced not doing their 'effects', ie: spell fields, because of returning the code after finding the first item. All of the changes related to this can be overriden in @Step and @itemStep.
	- Paralyzed characters won't move to any t_telepad or t_moongate location if they are freezed or stoned.
	- t_shrine was blocking the effect of any other items in its location, so now if players place any field or explotion or whatever upon it = free reskill.
Added #2380: Spell Fields check now the Z when creating, adjusting their position to it.
	Moved the FIX: code to FixZ() for CItem and CChar.
	Added also a bool bForceFix to MoveTo forcing a FixZ() after the Object positioning, updated the whole pack of *::MoveTo() to accept the new bool.
Fixed #2381: Reveal not removing the memory when spell s_invisibility was casted (layer 39) (only removing potion effect (layer 44)).
Added m_defenseBase and m_defenseRange splitting up the m_attackBase/Ranged properly between armor and damage instead of using it for everything.
Enabled some disabled variables for KR client status bar.

09-08-2014, Ben
Fixed: Another issue with stairs...

10-08-2014, Ben
Fixed #2383: Weight not changing after a baseid change resulting in weird weight calculations.
Fixed #2382: Reveal causing server freeze.
Fixed: Paperdoll not updating body color when using invis spell

11-08-2014, matex
Added EF_NoDiagonalCheckLOS = 00000001. Disables Diagonal Passage checks for legacy LOS. (Not advanced LOS)
Added FACING function to objects which will give you the direction the object/npc would turn to if it looks towards SRC.
Optionally FACING takes a location or uid as argument. This UID/location replaces SRC in that context.

16-08-2014, Ben
Fixed #2386: Ghosts can't pass through doors anymore
Fixed #2385: No swing animation during combat, @HitTry doesn't fire.
Fixed #2387: Hunger/starving causing wrong damage.
Fixed #2380: Field spells creating items on incorrect Z. (Caused by the Fix funtion. Fix should now work better in all places)

18-08-2014, XuN
Fixed some problems with ResPhysical.
Added @Resurrect trigger:
	- argn1 is the hitpoints value the char will have when resurrected (RW).
	- argo is the corpse (if any near) (R).
Fixed some items removed from view in some circumstances.

26-08-2014, Ben
Fixed: SLEEP causing NPCs to die with double corpse.

04-09-2014, matex
Fixed: character hue not updating when Char is revealed.

04-09-2014, matex
Xun made the WEIGHT property on writable on items. I renamed it BASEWEIGHT because we need
WEIGHT not to return the weight of a single instance but also of the whole stack in scripts.
So WEIGHT is read-only again. If you want to change the base weight, use BASEWEIGHT.

07-09-2014, matex
Fixed: Armor not updating when BaseID is changed on an Item.
Fixed: EF_FixCanSeeInClosedConts always enabled in Debug builds
Fixed: Walking code. Only stair statictiles are priorized now near the map-surface. Platform tiles not. (players were falling through map surface)
Fixed: Order in which NPCvendor boxes are sent to the player (display bug)

10-09-2014, matex
Refactored some of the walking code. You now need NPC's and Players to have MT_INDOORS definitely for them to be able
to go under static tiles.
Changed MT_INDOORS to MT_NOINDOORS. Think that makes more sense.

13-09-2014, matex
Built in LOCAL.ArrowHandled for @HIT, @HITMISS
so if you set this to something different from 0 in the triggers
the server will not BOUNCE drop the arrow to the Target's feet on MISS
or bounce it to the Targets BP on hit. You can handle this yourself.
If you do nothing, the arrow will be deleted if Local.ArrowHandled != 0
You can prevent it from being deleted by moving it in the Trigger.

13-09-2014, Ben
Fixed #2397: Return 1 should now prevent the guards from coming under @callguards in all instances

- Fixed #2405: Players becoming criminal when attack someone on the same guild.
- Changed: Increased NPCs view range from 12 to 14 tiles. This also affects the range to call guards.
- Changed: Cooking skill is now a craft skill.

10-10-2014, XuN
- Added local.anim and local.animDelay (this last one only working for classic clients) to @HitTry, so animations can be disabled and fired later in @hit (to remove the odd behaviour with new animation packets, which doesn't have delay).
- Added OF_NODClickTarget to ini, enabling this will not make the cursor appear as a target when double clicking weapons to equip them.

11-10-2014, Ben
- Added #2394: SMSG_DEF_UNICODE, MSG_DEF_UNICODE, IMSG_DEF_UNICODE to sphere_msgs.scp. If set to 1, messages will be sent in unicode unless overwriten with the the mode in @hue,font,mode.

11-10-2014, Coruja

14-10-2014, Coruja
- Added: New MAGICF_NOCASTFROZENHANDS setting on sphere.ini. If enabled, this will prevent cast spells if the char got paralyzed holding something on hands.
- Added: Missing behavior for SPELLCHANNELING item property. It's now working fine, items using this property won't get unequiped when casting spells.
- Fixed: Triggers @Start (spell trigger) and @SpellCast (char trigger) unequiping weapons and playing the spell cast animation even when the cast got denied using 'return 1'.
- Changed: Updated width/radius internal values for area/field spells (nothing really changed, just hardcoded values already set on sphere_spells.scp to be the default internal value if there's no value defined on scripts to override it).
- Changed: Create Food spell is now target-based. Using SPELLFLAG_TARG_* the food will be created on ground at target location, otherwise it will be created on caster backpack.
  [sphere_msgs.scp]: Added new messages for 'spell_create_food' and 'spell_try_frozenhands'.
  [sphere_spells.scp]: Removed target flags on Create Food spell. It will now create the item on backpack by default.

- Added: New VendorTradeTitle feature on sphere.ini. If enabled, it will show the job title on vendor names (eg: Alan the Carpenter).
- Changed: Corpses now will be created with TAG.OVERRIDE.MAXWEIGHT already set (value is always the same as char MAXWEIGHT). This will prevent overweight problems if someone drop many heavy items on a player corpse and then resurrect the player just to make him get stuck.

20-10-2014, Coruja
- Changed: Scissors won't cut hair/beard anymore. Now proper items are needed to do it, like items usually found on NPC Barber (hair restyling, hair dye, etc).
- Changed: Sewing Kit can't be used directly on bolts of cloth anymore. To use the bolts of cloth we must cut it using scissors first.
- Fixed #2421: Using scissors on bolts of cloth now will convert it properly to cloth.

23-10-2014, XuN
- Changed Argn3 in @UserWarMode to force a war/peace status ( 0 = do nothing, 1 = force peace, 2 = force war).
  NOTE: Argn3 is no longer deleting Attacker's lists, to do so use attacker.clear.

26-10-2014, Coruja
- Changed: Many improvements on pet stables behavior.
  Also the max limit of pets that the NPC can hold for a player now is based on player skills (Animal Taming + Animal Lore + Veterinary). Usually it can hold 2~8 pets.
  If TAG.MAXPLAYERPETS is set on the NPC, it will override the formula and will be default value for all players.

- Added: Account character creation now will create characters with MAXFOLLOWERS=5 already set.
- Fixed: House customization engine creating doors using wrong type 't_door' instead 't_door_locked'.
- Fixed: EMOTE_DEF_* defs not working on attack messages (*Someone is attacking you!*).
- [sphere_msgs.scp] Changed 'stablemaster_*' defmsg to new defs/texts. I HIGHLY recommend update it, since the old 'stablemaster_*' defmsgs won't be used anymore.

27-10-2014, XuN
- Attacker.clear can be used now even if character doesn't have a Attacker list, so no error is log in console.

- Changed Read mode for 'Title', now giving it a parameter will return the 'Trade Title' (Grandmaster Swordsmanship, Journeyman bowcraft, etc) instead of the custom title. (Example of usage: <title 1>).

29-10-2014, XuN
- Added can_i_forcedc (sphere_defs.scp), adding this flag to an item will allow it to be DClickable in every situation: from one side of the map to another, or even in another map, weared by another character, or GMs too, no checks at all.
  NOTE: Player's cant DClick what they don't see but they will be able to do it with the LastObject macro, or by knowing the UID and using 3rd party programs, be aware of that.

02-11-2014, XuN
- Fixed GetNPCBrain() not working as it should and returning wrong brain (in internal usages) and ignoring the Brain used in CHARDEFS in some cases.
- Added Ignore value to Attackers: Setting it to 1 will make the character ignore this target (mostly used by NPCs), when looking for target.
  @CombatAdd has now 2 arguments:
    Argn1 = Initial Threat (If used).
    Argn2 = Setting it to 1 make this enemy to be added as Ignored. (Setting it to 1 for a player in every NPCs will make this player be 'invisible' for them, good to create a faction system and such things).

02-11-2014, XuN, Ben, Feeh (and tons of help from Karma).
- Ship's patch:
  Added Packet 0xF6 (New Ship's Movement): This packet is affecting ships on client > 7.0.8d (High Seas ones), regardless of the multi files, patched ship's or not patched ones... it's a client's packet.
  Added Packet 0xF3 (Packet Container): Used to send tons of items/chars at once in one only packet, used to send items and chars inside multis (Houses and Ships). Clients > 7.0.0 (Stygian Abyss).
  Added ShipSpeed and SpeedMode for [Multidef ] definitions:
    ShipSpeed=2,1 (Period,Tiles): Period (in Tenths of second) tell the ship the delay until it moves again, tiles means the tiles moving (Default and suggested is 1, others won't work because of ... (read next line)).
    SpeedMode=(0x01 = one tile, 0x02 = rowboat, 0x03 = slow, 0x04 = fast). This modes have no sense until we have MultiThreading and can change the ticks per sec from 10 to 100 to make ships to move each 0.25seconds (which we cannot now).

  Updated multis_ships.scp with these new values.
  Fixed ship's planks not working.
  Updated the Update and Move (and their related functions) to send the minimal updates required, hence making less rubberband effects.
  Fixed some issues with EC and ships making visual strange effects, items staying behind the ship.
  Fixed some problems when turning the ships.
  Some more minor tweaks related to ships.
  
  NOTE: Mouse Wheel Movement packet is NOT included in this commit.

- Added: Wisdom racial trait on elves (they always have +20 max mana). It works only if FEATURE_ML_UPDATE is enabled on sphere.ini
- Changed: 'Open Bankbox' / 'Check Balance' context menu buttons on NPC Banker (brain_banker) now will make the NPC hear 'bank'/'balance' words instead call hardcoded functions to open bank or check balance. In other words: now both context menu buttons and spoken commands are consistent and can be softcoded.

23-11-2014, Coruja

- Fixed: @GetHit trigger not returning some ARGN2 values (like dam_fixed).

24-01-2015, Ben
- Fixed: Undefined keyword 'ITEM' error when restocking vendors.
- Modified: Order of @Create triggers to satify all situations.
    1 - CHARDEF's @Create runs first with @NPCRestock that follows (character does not have a position yet)
    2 - The character is placed in the world (This should fire @Enter in the appropriate region, and unlike before, the character is fully created)
    3 - TEVENTS @Create is fired (character now has a position)
    4 - EVENTSPET @Create is fired

24-01-2015, XuN
- Stackable items with different 'new variables' like ResPoison, UsesCur, etc cannot be stacked anymore.
- Added MaxAmount variable to stackable items with a default value of 65535 (not using this means no changes). This affect both Itemdefs and already created items (which can differ if you set to).
- Droping on self/backpack and bouncing stackable items now makes Sphere trying to reach MaxAmount,
    so if you have one pile of 50k of gold and you drop another 50k you'll end with one stack with 65535 coins and another one with 34465,
    obviously, if you set [itemdef i_gold] to MaxAmount=50000 this will not happen.
- Maximum value of MaxAmount keeps being unsigned short, the same, 65535 because of client limitation.
  Non stackable items doesn't have MaxAmount


26-01-2015, XuN
- Added 'click' function, doesn't need explanation I think.
- Setting UsesMax will raise UsesCur too if UsesCur is 0.

27-01-2015, XuN
- Updated @CombatDelete trigger with a new argn1 value, now it's telling Sphere to remove or keep 1/0 the attacker's memories when removing him from the list.
- Added @HitIgnore trigger firing when one character is going to avoid an ignored target in the target selection: argn1=1 keep him ignored, argn2= un-ignore target (so character can attack him again).
- Added @Eat trigger, read wiki for more info: http://wiki.sphere.torfo.org/index.php/@Eat

28-01-2015, Coruja

    Added missing tooltips for Insured (attr_insured), Quest Item (attr_questitem) and Crafted by [CharName] (CRAFTEDBY property)
    Added weight tooltip on all movable items if FEATURE_ML_UPDATE feature is enabled on sphere.ini (although it's not a ML feature, OSI started using this tooltip only on ML)
    [sphere_msgs.scp]: Removed 'tooltip_tag_amount' text

29-01-2015, Coruja
- Changed: Major improvement on combat engine (damage/resist calculations)
    COMBAT_SPECIALDAMAGE and COMBAT_USE_RESISTANCE settings on sphere.ini are now a single COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE which does the same thing (but now unified).
    COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE now totally overrides pre-AOS AR calculations with AOS damage/resist types instead use both at the same time.
    Fixed formula for AR calculation
    Fixed formula for char damage calculation. If unarmed (wrestling) the base damage will be the char DAM (usually 1-4), and using weapons the base damage will be the weapon damage. This base damage can be increased with some bonuses (if COMBAT_OSIDAMAGEMOD is enabled, it will use OSI bonus calculation, otherwise it will use sphere default bonus [STR/10]).
    On AOS+ clients, the char status menu now will show exactly the damage range that the char can deal (including all bonuses)
    New blood effects
    Old [Physical/Fire/Cold/Poison/Energy]Damage properties got removed and replaced with the new DAM[Physical/Fire/Cold/Poison/Energy].
[Sphere.ini]: Removed COMBAT_TARGETTEDHIT, COMBAT_SPECIALDAMAGE and COMBAT_USE_RESISTANCE settings, and added COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Removed all "combat_hit_*" messages.

30-01-2015, XuN
- Improved how Notoriety is checked for pets with PetsInheritNotoriety flags in the ini, now the notoriety is redirected instantly to pet's owner to avoid some checks and speed up the code. (Nothing has changed, it's just an improvement)

- Splitted stats regens from CChar::OnTick() to CChar::Stats_Regen()
- Re-Added old polymorph stats boost under MAGICF_POLYMORPHSTATS (0800) in sphere.ini.

30-01-2015, Coruja
- Added: 5 new optional arguments on DAMAGE function to make it compatible with COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE feature
    Sintax: DAMAGE value, dam_flag, source, physical(%), fire(%), cold(%), poison(%), energy(%)
    Example: DAMAGE 50,dam_general,012345,70,30,0,0,0 will split 50 damage into 70% physical damage + 30% fire damage
- Added: Internal support for COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE on spells, explosion potion, etc
- Added: New OSI formula to calculate spell damage if MAGICF_OSIFORMULAS feature is enabled

04-02-2015, Ben

- Fixed #2467: Orc ship north missing 1 component.

07-02-2015, Ben
- Added: Outgoing Packet Filtering using keyword OUTPACKETx=function_name in sphere.ini (works exactly like PACKETx=function_name but for outgoing packets)

13-02-2015, Coruja
- Changed: Increased the area radius to call guards [14 -> 18 tiles].
- Changed: RESPHYSICAL won't be merged with AR anymore, now both properties can have independent values. Sphere will choose the property to display on client status gump based on COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE setting on sphere.ini (enabled = RESPHYSICAL / disabled = AR).
- Added: Weapons and armors now will automatically set DAM*/RES* char properties on equip/unequip.
- Fixed: Login internal behavior adding TAG.LastHit=0 on chars even when COMBAT_PREHIT is disabled. This tag is only used by COMBAT_PREHIT, so if it's disabled the tag won't be added anymore.
- Fixed #2391: Nearby char names showing wrong notoriety color on client login.

15-02-2015, Coruja
- [sphere_defs.scp]: Added missing defs for 'colors_metal' and 'colors_bright'

Updated sphereCrypt.ini with clients up to 7.0.43.
Added 'stacking' behaviour to NightSight property to allow more than 1 item apply it's value and not removing the nightsight effect when unequipping (this will fix #2475),

	CombatBonusPercent stores the percentaje of stat applied onto the bonus calculations, value can be negative but total bonus cannot be lower than 1.
[sphere_msgs.scp]
Added these lines:

	//msg_acc_passclear_relog	"Log out, then back in to set the new password.""
	//msg_acc_acceptpass		"Password has been set."

23-03-2015, Coruja

Added: Support for RESDISP/RESLEVEL 8 on accounts, it's the default RESDISP for High Seas expansion (clients >= 7.0.9.0).

24-03-2015, XuN
Fixed some code from PacketWheelBoatMove (Move ships with mouse) and enabled it via 'Pilot' variable in ships holding the value of character and one memory item (acting like a horse)
Added few checks for Combat_NoDirChange

Scripts:
 Added t_pilot to sphere_defs.scp
 Updated \items\sphere_item_ship_parts_*.scp adding t_pilot.	//It seems that britannian and orcish ships got their items changed and they look empty now, i did not change this atm.
 Added \Add-On\HighSeas\Ships\HS_Pilot.scp with behaviour for t_pilot and memory item for mouse sailing.
 Added //itemuse_crook_target			"Where do you want them to go ?" to sphere_msgs.scp

26-03-2015, Coruja

26-03-2015, XuN
Added 5 more args to .effect function to give support to packet 0c7, new values are: EffectID,ExplodeID,SoundID,UID,Type. Seems to work only on EC.
Added Bonded property for npcs with very basic functionality, setting it to 1 doesn't let NPCs die.
Removed some debug msgs.
Changed some more m_Act_Targ to m_Fight_Targ.
Corpses retrieve killer's uid now from Attacker_GetLast() instead of on ACT.

27-03-2015, XuN
Changed DClick of t_ship_plank using SetDispID() instead of SetID() so they are threated as ship parts and 'fliped' with the rest of the ship.
Changed the 'Undefined symbol '' ' output format, now also prints what was the problem exactly in some situations. IE: if (<local.hello==1) // missing '>' will print 21:15:ERROR:(s_add.scp,21)Undefined symbol '' ['<local.hello==)']
[sphere_spells.scp]: Added missing '>' to local.damagetype in s_explosion.
Added another block of code for @SeeCrime, now it fires also when a 3rd part sees a crime (I'm seeing Player X attacking Player Y while Y is 'good'), to decide if mark as 'bad guy' the aggresor for this character.
	argn1 = attacker
	argn2 = victim
	argn3 = 1=criminal / 0='turn eyes away'
Fighting Memory will also remove flag MEMORY_AGGREIVED when expiring (NEED feedback on this) to avoid blue-innocent player becoming criminal when the fight memory of the attacker expires (if he attacked back).
Being attacked is not giving MEMORY_AGGREIVED to memory item, I might be attacked but it may not have to do anything with me being aggreived ... they may have been attacked by me first (Need feedback on this too).

28-03-2015, XuN
[sphere_defs.scp]:
	Added Expansion definitions.
	Added t_rope
[items/sphere_item_unsorted]:
	Added t_rope to i_rope
[multis_ships.scp]:
	Changed Height from all Tokuno ships from 7 to 17.
	Added Expansion=EXPANSION_HS to all HS ships.
[add-on/HighSeas/Ships/HS_pilot.scp]:
	Added mount check to t_pilot to prevent the memory item being bounced to pack.

Added t_rope working like t_ship_plank but making no changes on ID, by default it doesn't have any 'I'm in ship' checks when steping them for two reasons, ropes should be in ships and this way they can be used in houses to go out?
Added <TEXTF > function returning formatted text, example:
	[defname exampledef]
	test=Hello %s, I'll teach you for %d coins.
	message=<textf "<def.test>",<src.name>,15> // Quotes are A MUST.

29-03-2015, XuN

31-03-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Arch Protection spell not working correctly with COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE enabled.
Fixed: Resurrection spell not displaying correct EFFECT_ID / SOUND.
Added: MAGICF_OSIFORMULAS behavior on more spells.

01-04-2015, matex
Fixed: SYSCMD never could return an exit value and was hanging sometimes.

01-04-2015, XuN

Added scripts/items/sphere_item_provisions_logs.scp with different log types.
Changed scripts/items/sphere_item_provisions.scp: Moved i_log(s) / i_board(s) to scripts/items/sphere_item_provisions_logs.scp

01-04-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Buff/Debuff spells not working correctly when MAGICF_OSIFORMULAS is disabled.
[sphere_item_provisions_logs.scp]: Fixed some boards using wrong itemdef.

02-04-2015, XuN
Added Repair function (Called on Repareid item, must be called with a character as SRC, who is going to perform the repair action).
Added Smelt function ( called on Smelted item, must be called with a character as SRC. ARGS=forge or another ore pile to smelt, if no ARGS is given it will search automatically for nearest forge if any ).
Changed @StatGain trigger is not being fired anymore with any stat changes from the @Create trigger.
Fixed local.CreateObject1 & 2 in @Success trigger for field spells causing the new items to do not use the same placement checks as default items.
Updated behaviour of Bonded Pets ONLY when they are DEAD:
	-They act as normal for everything, excepting they cannot die.
	-Follow any master's command, excepting fighting ones.
	-Doesn't regenerate stats.
	-NPCs won't die if they have bonded=1, if they are dead already and bonded is set to 0 they will die in next ticks.
	-Stam required to step over them is 0.
	-Food doesn't decay.
Fixed: Pets following when recalling/teleporting/gate travelling should be more consistent.
Changed: Mounted items calls now CChar::OnTick() on the mounted character instead of doing the tick on it's own, so they regenerate stats and everything like any other character in a more realistic way.
Fixed STATSUM and STAT_STR/DEX/INT from SkillClasses not being readed correctly (or at all) in some cases, this should permanently stop the need of custom statcaps. This is how StatGain works today (** = what was fixed):
	-Only INT can be gained when Polymorphed.
	-Stats with any StatLock different than UP can't increase.
	-StatCap <= StatSum stops the execution. **
	-STAT_* > STAT_VALUE from SkillClass = ignore this stat **
	-STAT_* > STAT_VALUE for this Stat in the performed Skill = ignore this stat.
	-Then the checks for %chances are made.
[sphere_msgs.scp]:
	Added //msg_bonded_dead_cantmount			"The creature is dead and cannot be mounted."

03-04-2015, Coruja
Fixed: EXP/LEVEL going < 0 on chars when the property value is changed by scripts using @ExpChange / @ExpLevelChange triggers.
Fixed: CUSTOMIZE function not hiding correctly all dynamic items on multi when entering on customization mode.

06-04-2015, Coruja
Fixed: NPC Guards (brain_guard) incorrectly teaching skills to players.
Fixed: Protection spell not returning the Magic Resistance skill to correct value if this skill was set to lock/down on the skill menu (when COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE is enabled).
Fixed: Mana Drain, Wall of Stone and Energy Vortex spells using wrong EFFECT / DURATION if MAGICF_OSIFORMULAS is enabled.

08-04-2015, XuN
Changes in @Effect/@SpellEffect triggers for spells:
	Local.CreateObject1 overrides the effect id.
	Added Local.EffectColor, local.EffectRender and local.EffectExplode allowing to override the values of the sent effect.

Added Local.EffectColor to @Success/@SpellSuccess to change the color of field spells.

Reordered how effects are called (now they are all together inside SpellEffect()) to have better access to them.
Removed some Effect() calls to prevent two effects being sent in some spells.
Removed Effect_Bolt(), its now handled by SPELLFLAG_FX_BOLT inside SpellEffect().
*Any of this changes are affecting lightning spells, since client ignores everything related to lightnings (.effect 1,1).

Changed @SpellCast / @Start trigger for characters / spells:
	- Added local.WOP=0/1 to disable/enable WOP for this character / spell.
	- Added local.WOPColor (default = SERV.WOPColor) to change Word of Power's color for this character / spell .
	- Added local.WOPFont (default = SERV.WOPFont) to change WOP's font for this character / spell .

Fixed: Some spell formulas incorrectly using the skill value from target instead caster.

Fixed NewGold not calling @Create if any new pile was created.
Fixed NewGold not taking care of MaxAmount.

15-04-2015, XuN
Added to sphere_msgs.scp:	(emotes for poison seems to have different values for poisoned character and the other ones)
for poisoned characters:
	//spell_osipoison_lesser		"feel a bit nauseous"
	//spell_osipoison_standard		"feel disorientated and nauseous!"
	//spell_osipoison_greater		"begin to feel pain throughout your body!"
	//spell_osipoison_deadly		"feel extremely weak and are in severe pain!"
	//spell_osipoison_lethal		"are in extreme pain, and require immediate aid!"
for viewers:
	//spell_osipoison_lesser1		"looks ill."
	//spell_osipoison_standard1		"looks extremely ill."
	//spell_osipoison_greater1		"stumbles around in confusion and pain."
	//spell_osipoison_deadly1		"is wracked with extreme pain."
	//spell_osipoison_lethal1		"begins to spasm uncontrollably."

CHANGED Poison function:
	By default it accepts 1 parameter (skill level)
	It can now have a second parameter for duration ticks (If not given, ticks are calculated as always = SkillLevel /50 ).

Added new behaviour for poison spell under MAGIFC_OSIFORMULAS:
	Poison Level = (Magery + Poisoning) /2:	(Stored in MoreY)
		Lesser (0):		Level <= 65.0
		Standard (1):	Level <= 85.0
		Greater (2):	Level < 100.0
		Deadly (3):		Level > 100.0
	Poison can be Lethal also with a 10% chances if the magery and poisoning of the poisoner are greather than 100.0 and distance < 3 tiles.
	Tick Period: 
		Lesser =		2 seconds.
		Standard =		3 seconds.
		Greater =		4 seconds
		Deadly/Lethal = 5 seconds.
	Duration:(More2) (if poison spell is called from POISON function, this values will be applied only if argn2 == 0, if set to another value then the given value will be used)
		Lesser =		30 seconds.
		Standard =		30 seconds.
		Greather =		60 seconds.
		Deadly =		60 seconds.
		Lethal =		80 seconds.
	Damage:(Currently values for poisons > Lesser are calculated on SpellEffect (MoreZ), so the same damage is dealed in each tick, AFAIK this is how it works)
		Lesser =		4-7% current hp.
		Standard =		5-10% max hp.
		Greater =		7-15% max hp.
		Deadly =		15-30% max hp.
		Lethal =		16-33% max hp

Added new ini flag COMBAT_NOPOISONHIT :Disables old (55i like) poisoning style: Poisoning > 30.0 && (RAND(100.0)> Poisoning) for monsters OR weapon.morez && (RAND(100) < weapon.morez ) for poisoned weapons.
INFORMATION: These have been unchanged, i'm writing here however for information of how is the poison's strenght calculated.
	Poison applied using weapon: src.poison <eval <weapon.morez>*10>,<eval <weapon.morez>/5> (so morez*10 = poison damage and morez/5 = ticks)
	Poison applied by monsters: src.poison <eval <r<Poisoning>>>, <r<eval <Poisoning>/50>>	(so strength is a rand of the poisoning skill and ticks are poisoning skill / 50
	Poisoned food has not been altered either, but here is the formula too: src.poison <eval <morez>*10>,1+<eval <morez>/50> (so the food's morez*10 is the strenght and ticks = morez /50 too).

15-04-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Some skills only rising until 30.0% on specific situations.
Changed: Some small changes on Magic Reflection spell.

27-04-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Guilds not display notoriety correctly on players with recruit access level.
Fixed: Magic Reflection effect only working on spells with SPELLFLAG_RESIST set. Now only spells with direct target (SPELLFLAG_TARG_CHAR) can be reflected.
Fixed: Spells with SPELLFLAG_HARM flag not flagging the caster criminal when it got resisted/reflected by the target.
Changed: Some improvements on Magic Resistance (skill) effect.
[Sphere.ini]: Added new ColorNotoInvulGameMaster setting to tweak the name notoriety color on invul Game Master chars (purple by default).
[sphere_spells.scp]:
	-Added missing DURATION on Mana Drain spell.
	-Updated SPELLFLAG_RESIST / SPELLFLAG_TARG_NOSELF on some spells.

28-04-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Mounts not creating the corpse when it die while ridden.

Changed: Removed max limit of CURFOLLOWER=255 on OF_PetSlots feature.
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Added new 'charinfo_bonded' message to show [bonded] tag on chars with BONDED=1 set (it will override the [tame] tag by default).

02-05-2015, XuN
REMOVED tag.override.noto completely now, @NotoSend was made as an enhanced version of this tag.
Added: argn2 in @NotoSend trigger forcing the character's packet to use this value as character's color but not modifying the real notoriety.
Changed: @NotoSend argn1 value now only can have values between 1 (NOTO_GOOD) and 7 (NOTO_INVUL) if other value is given it will be ignored and default checks will be made, color will still be used (if value >= 0)
Updated http://wiki.sphere.torfo.org/index.php/@NotoSend information.

Fixed some cases in which victims of a crime (attacked characters) became criminals. Also, but not always related to the same scenario, Notoriety not checking flags for MEMORY_HARMEDBY, which was causing the 'criminal issue' and also a bunch of unnecessary checks.
Fixed Guards being able to be flagged as criminals and doing the whole checks: Guards always acts for the law and they will never be criminal (this has been this way always but checks were performed anyway).
All of this fixed too @SeeCrime from combat not always working.
CHANGED: Old @SeeCrime is now @SeeSnoop http://wiki.sphere.torfo.org/index.php/@SeeSnoop
ADDED: New @SeeCrime trigger for every crime unrelated to Snooping: http://wiki.sphere.torfo.org/index.php/@SeeCrime

Fixed argn2 on @NotoSend not working as intended (notice that PetsInheritNotoriety may affect and block this).

07-05-2015, XuN
Updated sphere_serv_triggers.scp with some information/comments and values for newly created characters.
Added Notoriety values changed via @NotoSend to be sent in character's names: 
	-argn2 has priority over anything else, if it's value is 0, lesser or not present at all then argn1 will be used, if there's no argn1 either then default checks will be made.
	-argn2 values from 1 to 7 will read color hues from ini ones (NOTO_GOOD,NOTO_CRIMINAL...NOTO_INVUL,etc).
Poison spell and habilities based on it are now affected by SPELLFLAG_NoUnparalyze (if set).
Fixed some errors appearing when a character dies while poisoned conflicting with PacketDeathAnimation.
Poison damage has now DAM_MAGIC flag set.
Uncommented EFFECT value for Poison spell in sphere_spells.scp

08-05-2015, Coruja
Added: New 'Add/Remove Party Member' missing popup button when click on another player to invite/remove him from an party.
Changed: Some updates/optimizations on party engine.
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Updated 'party_*' messages.
[sphere_defs.scp]: Added missing 'attr_opened' value on [DEFNAME attr_flags] list.

09-05-2015, XuN
Fixed: Ignored 'attackers' will not be chosen as targets anymore, even if they are the only enemies on the list.
Added: Field spells will fire @Create for their itemdefs/events, also @ItemCreate for characters with a 'tag.BadLoc' which will be true if they are going to be placed above any character.
	If tag keeps at 1 after the @Create trigger the field will be removed like it's been doing recently.
	Since fields will not be placed until they are allowed to (to avoid 'ghost' walls dissapearing), items will have a 'tag.pos' with the placement position.

09-05-2015, Coruja
Added: New updated Swing Speed combat formula. It's almost the same as the previous formula (pre-AOS) but more accurate and with support to Swing Speed Increase property (INCREASESWINGSPEED).
[sphere.ini]: Updated 'SpeedScaleFactor' setting to the recommended value for the new Swing Speed formula [15000 -> 80000]. Although the old (or any other value) can be used, it's HIGHLY recommended update it to get better results.
[npcs/sphere_monsters.scp]: Added MAXFOLLOWER, RESPHYSICALMAX, RESFIREMAX, RESCOLDMAX, RESPOISONMAX, RESENERGYMAX properties on playable chars (c_man, c_woman, c_elf_male, c_elf_female, c_gargoyle_male, c_gargoyle_female).
[sphere_serv_triggers.scp]: Removed RES*MAX from f_onchar_create (it was moved directly to chardefs).

10-05-2015, Ben
Added: ABS() intrinsic function wich returns the absolute of any number ( <eval abs(5)> = 5, <eval abs(-5)> = 5 )

13-05-2015, XuN
  Receiving 0 damage will not generate blood anymore.
  Improved the code for 'Attacker'.
  
  Updated/improved/cleaned Spells:
    - Added internal definitions for all spells
    - Added support for spells with id 1000 to 1055 for custom spells and other old spells, reflected changes in sphere_spells.scp*
    - t_spellbook_extra works with values 1000+
    - Changed NPCs formulas to make them able to cast spells from other books than MAGERY one, selected from skills with SKF_MAGIC**:
    - Fixed the formula to select the maximum spell NPCs can cast because any npc with magery > 10.0 could cast all spells, now maxspell is calculated like this (using magery as example):
      maxspell = MULDIV(Skill_GetValue(magery),Spells_GetMax(magery),Skill_GetMax(magery)). To get a real progression for skill's capabilities this adjusts automatically to each skill's max spells, so 78.2 necromancy will let npcs cast up to spell 12 and 71.4 magery will let npc cast up to spell 37 for example.
      Skill_GetValue() returns the current value for this skill,
      Spells_GetMax() returns the total amount of spells for this skill (64 for magery, 17 for necromancy...),
      SkillGetMax() returns the maximum amount of this skill (Based on skillclass for players and 100.0 (or tag.override.skillcap_&skill if present) for NPCs)
    - NOTE: This has not been changed, and it's ONLY for magery as it was before (since other skills was not being checked): spells are selected in a FOR loop so, for magery and to avoid big loops each time a spell must be selected, first spell being checked is <r<maxspell>>. So if maxspell = 50 it will choose spells between <r50> and 50.

  [sphere_defs.scp]:
    - added spellflag_heal             040000000  // spell used to heal hitpoints or resurrect
    - added LAYER_* definitions for all spells that need a layer item to handle their behaviour (behaviours not added).
  
  * [sphere_spells.scp]: 
    - Changed ID for spell number 64 to 1000 and so on with the next ones until spell 99.
    - Added spellflag_heal to s_heal,s_greater_heal,s_close_wounds,s_noble_sacrifice,s_gift_of_life,
    - Added flags to Spellweaving spells.
  ** [sphere_skills]: Added SKF_MAGIC to MAGERY,NECROMANCY,SPELLWEAVING,MYSTICISM and CHIVALRY
    - Added NPC_AI setting: 
      // NPC_AI_STRICTCAST    01000 NPC's will only select spells they really have in their spellbook. Old behaviour let them to select any spell with SPELLFLAG_HARM if they have magery enough to cast it regardless of spellbook.
      FIXED i_spellbook_spellweaving was MOREZ=0600, it should be 600
      FIXED argn2 for @SpellSelect couldn't be overriden for spells casted from T_WAND or T_SCROLL. ARGN2 is also set to the proper mana value (0 for T_WAND and RequiredMana /2 for I_SCROLL) for reading purposes.
      Updated comment for t_spellbook_extra       186   // some spellbook for script purposes (MOREZ=basic offset, should 1000 or more) in sphere_defs.scp
      Added morex for t_spellbook_extra to set the max amount of spells for this book, so morez = first spell and morex = last spell , for example morey=1000, morez=1016 will hold spells from 1000 to 1016

16-05-2015, Ben
- Fixed #2510: deathshroud not removing on resurrection in all cases.

17-05-2015, XuN
Updated @NPCActFight:
	Added - local.skill // Setting this to any skill will make the NPC begin this skill
	Added - local.spell // For magic skills this will be the casted spell
	Added - ACT // This will refer to the target, must be set since the trigger is using SRC for the first enemy
	Added - return 2 // The code above will only work when return = 2
Removed NPC_AI_STRICTCAST and all the invented casts from npcs.This can be reverted applying a trigger for npcs like this:
	ON=@NPCActFight
	if (<magery> > 0)
		local.spell=<r1,64>
		while (<local.spell> < 64)
			if (<CanCast <local.spell>>)
				local.skill=magery
				return 2
			else
				local.spell ++
			endif
		endwhile
	endif	//same for the other magic skills.

Added vector list storing all spells that npcs can cast and removed tons of lines of code to increase the performance of CPU when NPCs cast some spells.
WARNING:
	Added LAYER variable to spells, ALL SPHERE_SPELLS.SCP MUST BE UPDATED or spells with some effect, like polymorphs, summons, stat spells, and all that have a determinated duration will stop working
	[sphere_spells.scp]	//Seriously, this script must be updated.
		-Added LAYER=layer_spell_* to all magery, necromancy, spellweaving,chivalry and mysticism spells, ie LAYER=layer_spell_stats for s_bless,s_cunning, etc
Changed default formulas to make spells work with LAYER instead of hardcoded checks, this will help making custom spells by giving the customization enough to handle every possible effect.

Changed: MemoryEquip won't be called anymore for the memories of spell's effects.
Added character trigger @EffectAdd: This will be called when any type of effect memory is being added, like stat changes for s_bless, s_cunning... s_weaken ...
	Argo = memory item
	argn1 = spellid
returns: 
	return 0: Let default checks to happen.
	return 1: Blocks any action and stops everything, also deletes the memory (Blocking any changes, this will cause also the effect to do not have duration)
	return 2: Let the memory exist but block default checks, perfect to override default effects and do some custom stuff.
To simulate something like '@EffectEnd' just apply an event with @Timer to the memory since the 'default changes' are happening after @UnEquip and, at this point, the item must be removed in any case... so preventing this must be done before (@Timer fits perfectly).

19-05-2015, Coruja
Added: New animation on dragon breath attack.
Changed: Reduced SAY/speech max text length (1024 -> 256 chars). Client is limited to 128 chars on default speech and 256 chars on journal, so this can avoid some exploits from 3rd party assists/tools without affect the gameplay.
Changed: Major optimizations on walk, skills and general ticks code. It's working fine, but needs some heavy testing until we mark it as 100% stable.
	-IMPORTANT: Be sure to update your sphere_skills.scp with proper FLAGS on all fight/ranged/magic/craft/gather skills, otherwise these skills will not work correctly.

20-05-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Parrying skill check always returning 'true' (success) on chars with GM=1 set, making the char never receive any damage on combat even without invul flag set.
Fixed: Mounts disappearing on worldsave on some specific situations.
Changed: Improved Teleport/Dispel spell smoke animation.
Changed: Another huge optimization on skills code.
[Sphere.ini]: Updated TeleportEffectNPC / TeleportEffectPlayers settings with correct values.

22-05-2015, Coruja
Fixed: NPCs not following his owner/target correctly.
Changed: Some improvements on pet follower slots and pet bonding engine.
[sphere_defs.scp]: Added missing 't_healing_stone' on [TYPEDEFS] section.

22-05-2015, XuN
Major updates on code to fix compiler LVL4 warnings.
Changed sector's size for map 4 from 8 to 16  (so we only have 5k sectors on this map instead of 31k), improving heavily performance when this map is enabled.
NOTE: Disabling unused maps / using the less possible will increase the performance exponentially since each tick a loop for all maps and all it's sectors is fire, take this in count.

28-05-2015, Coruja
- Fixed: Spell buff/debuff icons showing wrong info on client login.
- [maps/sphere_map3.scp]: Added missing AREADEF a_isle_of_divide
- [maps/sphere_map4.scp]: Updated header comments
- [sphere_defs.scp]: Updated some cliloc values on 'buff_clilocs'
- [sphere_spells.scp]: Fixed Dispel Field spell flags [spellflag_targ_obj -> spellflag_targ_item]

29-05-2015, Coruja
- Some minor design updates on SphereSvr.exe file/console.

30-05-2015, XuN
- Added: TAG.SeenBy_uid for items with attr_invis allow these items to be seen by characters with the given uid, ie: tag.SeenBy_015af=1 will allow player with uid 015af to see this item, usefull for traps/quest items/etc.

- Changed return 2 from EffectAdd to return 0 to avoid some problems.
  Added only if FEATURE_AOS_B is enabled:
  - Behaviour for HitLeechMana on weapons: Returned mana = 0 - X. Where X is the HitLeechMana% of (Damage dealt * 0.4). More info in: http://www.uoguide.com/Hit_Mana_Leech
  - Behaviour for HitLeechLife on weapons: On every successful hit you will leech 0 to X percent health of (Damage done * 0.3) where X is the Hit Life Leech value on your weapon. (This means the same as HitLeechMana but using *0.3 instead of *0.4)
  - Behaviour for HitManaDrain on weapons: %of draining a 20% of the damage dealt from the enemy's mana. so HitManaDrain = 50 means a 50% of draining mana to the target. Mana drained = 20% of the damage done.
  - Behaviour for EnhancePotions on characters: Effect of the potion is increased by the % set on this property.
  
  Added default behaviours for the following necromancy spells (some of them was already working but not with their full effects):
  - s_curse_weapon = Adds +x HitLeechLife to any equipped weapon, while the spell is in effect unequiped weapons will get this bonus removed and equipped weapons will gain the bonus. X is stored at memory's morey (50 by default).
  - s_blood_oath = When a target of s_blood_oath damages the caster... the damage amount is increased, the target also receives the x% of damage than the caster. X by default should be 100, but its lowered to this formula: ((Resisting Spells Skill x 10) / 20) + 10. X is stored at memory's morey.
  - s_corpse_skin = Turns the victim's skin dry and corpse like. This temporarily decreases the target's fire and poison resists (Fire and Poison resist decreased by 15 (more1h) each), while increasing resistance to cold and physical damage (increasing both by 10 (more1L) each).
  - s_evil_omen = http://www.uoguide.com/Evil_Omen
  - s_pain_spike = http://www.uoguide.com/Pain_Spike
  - s_wraith_form = Gets + 15 Resphysical (more1h) and -5(more1l) ResEnergy/ResFire while the effect is active, it also grants the same effect (but not working with it's property) as HitLeechMana returning a % of the target's mana calculated from = Spirit Speak / 50 (24% at 120.0 Spirit Speak), also grants the ability to walk through creatures and players in Felucca
  - s_mind_rot = Decreases the LowerManaCost property on the character.
  - s_horrific_beast = Provides a bonus of unarmed damage (stored in more1l & more1h on the spell's memory, default = 5,9), Gains a +20 RegenHitsVal (more2) and +25 Melee damage increase (morey). It's also unable to cast other spells than polymorphing ones (@SpellCast in c_horrific_beast).
  - s_poison_strike = scripted.
  - s_wither = scripted.
  - s_strangle = Info here: http://www.uoguide.com/Strangle
  - s_lich_form = +13 RegenValMana (more1l), -5 RegenValHits (more1h), -10 ResFire and +10 ResPoison/ResCold ( all three stored in more2).
  - s_vampiric_embrace = +20% HitLeechLife (more1l), +15 RegenStamVal (more1h), +3 RegenManaVal (more2), -25 ResFire (morey).

  NOTES:
    - Almost all graphical effects for these spells are still not applied yet. Same for RUNE_ITEMs.
    - Polymorphs from Necromancy have an increased damage received from Undead Slayer Weapons, since there's no hardcoded support for Slayer Weapons (yet?) I didn't add it. Feel free to script it.
    - These Spells may not be working at 100% yet, just sent 'initial' code. sphere_spells.scp MUST be updated.
    - Some behaviours related to spells and props are going to change in the following days.
  
[sphere_defs.scp]
  - Added LAYER_Spell_BLood_Oath and modified the following values to match it's order.
[sphere_spells.scp]
  - Changed LAYER for s_strangle to LAYER_Spell_Strangle
  - Behaviour for s_wither
  - Behaviour for s_poison_strike
  - Flags, RUNE_ITEM and more values for spells 100+.
  - Added code under @Select for all spellflag_polymorph spells to unpolymorph who is already polymorphed (same as s_polymorph).
[sphere_monsters.scp]
  - Added: c_horrific_beast -> ON=@SpellCast trigger avoiding any casts for this creature if a player is morphed on it.
[sphere_item_deco_signs.scp] (Darksun)
  - Added missing definitions for all signs.
[sphere_item_magic_necromancer_aos.scp]
  - Added fake runes for all necromancy spells, they don't have real entries in tiledata but i'm using custom itemdefs with their scrolls as baseid.

- Taking in count lot of recent changes realized that some properties must properly shown or hidden according to some ini flags, so ResFire,ResPhysical, etc will only be shown on item's ToolTips if COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE is enabled

31-05-2015, Coruja
- Changed: Some small code improvements on HITLEECH[LIFE/MANA/STAM] properties.
- Changed: Messsage 'Expansion maps supported' on server startup now will show the real map name (Felucca, Ilshenar, Malas, ...) instead UO expansion name (T2A, LBR, AOS, ...)
- [Sphere.ini]: Changed all MAPx settings to use -1 as sector size. This will make sphere use the default sector size value (64x64) instead .ini value (32x32).

01-06-2015, Coruja
- Fixed: ABS() intrinsic function not working correctly.
- Changed: Some small improvements on AddContextMenuEntry function.

02-06-2015, Coruja
- Fixed: Console error when players die.
- Fixed: PacketDeathAnimation .ini setting not working correctly.
- Changed: Some improvements on 'death' / 'make corpse' internal code. Now any NPC will have corpse when it die (unless it was an summoned NPC). So don't get confused if you see corpses of some NPCs which previously doesn't have corpse (elementals, etc), it's the default OSI behavior. Also TAG.DEATHFLAGS can be used to force removal/creation of the corpse on @Death

03-06-2015, Coruja
Changed: Paralyze spell formula (AOS -> pre-AOS) when MAGICF_OSIFORMULAS is enabled.
Added: Functionality for BONUS[STR/DEX/INT], BONUS[HITS/STAM/MANA] and LOWERMANACOST properties.

04-06-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Damages not removing Paralyze effect.
Fixed: Console error when casting spells that have effect duration.
Changed: Some improvements on Blood Oath and Evil Omen spells (necromancy).

06-06-2015, XuN
Added some missing casts
Fixed DEBUG errors when entering/leaving RED areas.
Reverted back m_uidKiller in m_itCorpse to CGrayUIDBase to fix build not compiling.

06-06-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Field spells and triggers @Step (items) / @ItemStep (chars) not working correctly.

08-06-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Function AddContextEntry not working correctly on HS clients >= 7.0.0.0
Fixed: Dead bonded pets not updating the ghost corpse correctly on resurrect.
Fixed: Explosion potions causing damage to nearby items when it explodes.

10-06-2015, Coruja
Added: Player corpses now will turn into bones when it got carved or before it decay. Also improved the corpse carving behavior, and now when the corpse got carved it will place all items inside the bone container instead drop everything on the ground.
Fixed: Wrong message appearing when the char get flagged criminal (changed 'msg_criminal' to 'msg_guards').
Fixed: Poison/Paralyze Field spells continuously hitting the player at every second instead just hit when needed.
Fixed: Console error when an NPC cast Nightsight spell or use Meditation skill.
Changed: Invulnerable chars (FLAGS=statf_invul) now are able to attack another char instead get the attack "magically blocked".
[sphere_item_deco_dungeons_traps_dead.scp]: Removed TYPE=t_meat_raw, TDATA1 and VALUE from all 'i_flesh_*' items (they aren't foot and nor sellable items).
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Updated all 'carve_corpse_*' messages and removed 'msg_criminal', 'msg_magic_block'.
[sphere_spells.scp]: Added missing 'spellflag_tard_dead' on s_resurrection spell.
	-IMPORTANT: It's HIGHLY recommended update it, or Resurrection spell will stop working.

10-06-2015, XuN
Fixed: Res* not reducing damage anymore
Fixed: Having RegenHits/Mana/Val greater than ini's setting stoping the regen process forever for this character.

11-06-2015, Coruja
Changed: Some small improvements on explosion potion effect.
Fixed: Console error "Hair/Beard not in a corpse" when corpse bones got saved on worldsave.

12-06-2015, XuN
Changed all TAG.TamingSlots entries to FollowerSlots in: sphere_monsters.scp, sphere_monsters_custom.scp and spherechar_evil.scp.
Added @FollowersUpdate trigger called in any update of followers related to OF_PetSlots:
	argn1 (R/W): 0 = Adding followers (taming, unshrinking, summoning, buying ...), 1 = sustracting followers (release, transfer ...)
	argn2 (R/W): FollowerSlots used.
	SRC: Pet causing the trigger to run, when buying in vendors there's no PET yet, so SRC will point to the vendor.
	Return 1 will not allow following actions to occur: Transfer, Summon, UnShrinks from t_figurine, Buy from vendors. Any other actions (like release, set owner...) will not take in count returns.

13-06-2015, XuN
Fixed #2515: Added local.sound to @Effect and @SpellEffect triggers, by default it uses spell->sound excepting effects from potions which will have a random value between 0x030 and 0x031 (old value), this is writable, 0 means no sound.
Fixed #2517: Added BREATH.TYPE to Breath's animation, this will tell Sphere what type of effect to use (same types as .effect).
	- To help keeping old behaviour (explosion on target instead of following fireball) I added BREATH.ANIM and BREATH.TYPE to every brain_dragon in sphere_monsters.scp and sphere_monsters_custom.scp, just remove the // on these lines with a quick find&replace to enable old style breath.

14-06-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Summoned NPCs incorrectly creating corpses on death.
Fixed: Summoned mounts not disappearing on summon timer expiration if it was mounted.
Fixed: Region flags REGION_ANTIMAGIC_RECALL_IN and REGION_ANTIMAGIC_TELEPORT incorrectly blocking Resurrection spell effect.
Fixed: Client screen not being updated correctly when ghosts got resurrected.
Fixed: Possible console error when players/NPCs try pick/drop some specific items.
Fixed: Combat not flagging the attacker criminal if the attack was parried by the target.

16-06-2015, Coruja
Changed: Some optimizations on internal walk code and spell add/remove behavior.
Fixed: Paralyze effect not updating the client immediatelly when it goes off, making the client only able to walk after ~100ms on next tick update.
Fixed: Function SERV.MAP(x,y,z,m) returning console error instead '0' when 'm' is a invalid/disabled map.
[Sphere.ini]: Added new ItemsMaxAmount .ini setting. This will globally set max allowed amount for all stackable items (default is 60000).
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Removed 'msg_invisible' and 'msg_tingling' messages.

17-06-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Stamina not decreasing correctly when walk over another char.
Fixed: Packet to update char hitpoints being sent twice to nearby party members.
Fixed: Properties like STR/ModSTR/MaxHits/etc making the char have current status value > max allowed value when the status got lowered.

18-06-2015, Coruja
Changed: Combat now will make blood effects only for physical damage (wrestling / weapons).
Changed: Field spells casted over the same field already created on ground now will make the previous field tile got replaced with the new one.
Changed: Trigger @DropOn_Ground / @ItemDropOn_Ground now is fired when the item is already on the ground instead get fired before place it on ground. So there's no more ARGS showing the drop location P (use <ACT.P> instead) and also 'return 1' will disable drop sound and decay timer.
Fixed: ATTR 'attr_magic' and 'attr_newbie' incorrectly affecting the item decay timer when it got dropped on ground.
[Sphere.ini]: Updated ClientLinger setting with correct value.

19-06-2015, Coruja
Changed: NEWNPC function won't automatically place the created NPC on source P anymore. Like NEWITEM, the NPC will be created virtually and must be placed on the world using P=x,y. This will prevent the server send unnecessary/duplicated 'update' packets to clients.
Fixed #2514: Hiding / Stealth skills and Poison / Poison Field spells not updating the client screen correctly on action success.
Fixed #2518: Mounts losing bonded status on dismount.

21-06-2015, Coruja
Changed: Improved stamina checks when walking.
Fixed: Possible console error on specific char actions like walk, teleport and cast spells.

23-06-2015, Coruja
Changed: Some internal improvements on explosion potions code.
Changed: Items dropped on invalid location on ground now will get bounced to char backpack instead get moved to char P.
Fixed: Items being able to be dropped on ground inside walls tiles.
Fixed: Possible console error when casting field spells.
Fixed: CUSTOMIZE function on customizable multis not hiding correctly all house dynamic items on ground when client enter on customization mode.
Fixed: House customization menu making the char get moved to multi center when it switch to another floor level.

23-06-2015, matex
Changed: Disabled assertions in non-debug Linux builds. This should not be necessary anymore because there is a SIGSEGV handler in linux builds.
Added: Experimental feature for Sectorsleeping which can be enabled during compilation by using _SECTOR_INTTICK. 
It basically checks in a 3x3 matrix around each sector if there are any players around to determine if the sector is sleeping. 
This leads to a more intelligent distribution of available compute power on small maps (because then the Sectorsleepmask can be 
increased without any immediately 'noticeable' effects). It is not yet available in nightly builds because I consider it too performance 
critical to make it available via a Sphere.ini setting (this would induce an additional comparison in each tick.)

24-06-2015, XuN
Added TithingUse variable for [SPELL ] working like ManaUse but for Tithing Points.
Fixed #2521: delay reseting after the the trigger, so it was impossible to change it.
Added support for Tithing in spells, note that LowerManaCost doesn't affect Tithing points but LowerReagentsCost does it unlike for mana.
Fixed a typo causing humans to create 10% of t_hide when carving corpses instead of applying a bonus of 10%
sphere_msgs.scp: Added //spell_try_notithing			"You must have at least %s Tithing Points to use this ability"	//1060173
sphere_item_provisions_armor.scp: Updated Description and Subsection for gargoyle leather armor.
sphere_spells.scp: Added TithingUse to chivalry spells.

25-06-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Walking over ghosts requiring stamina to pass.
Fixed: Mounts disappearing on worldsave on some specific situations.
Added: New REFUSETRADES (bool 0/1) char property. If set to true (1), it will prevent others clients to open secure trades with this char.
Added: New 'Allow Trades' / 'Refuse Trades' context menu buttons to toggle REFUSETRADES property. Unfortunately only clients >= 7.0.30 can see these buttons because OSI added these cliloc texts only on this client version.
Added: New Hit Chance combat formula (more info: http://uo.stratics.com/content/arms-armor/combat.php#hitchance)
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Added new message 'msg_trade_refuse'.

26-06-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Sphere crash when drop an item on a invalid ground location.
Fixed: Function GOLD creating gold piles with max amount 65000 instead use ItemsMaxAmount value.

26-06-2015, XuN
Added left Racial bonuses for Elfs, Added all for Gargoyles excepting Master Artisan.
Added a missing call to Calc_CombatChanceToHit() from Fight_Attack(), making it to no check the chances to hit.
For more info about Racial bonuses, read here: http://www.uoguide.com/Racial_Abilities .
[sphere.ini]
	-Added FEATURE_ML_RACIAL_BONUS and FEATURE_SA_RACIAL_BONUS to FeatureML and FeatureSA respectively, each one activating the bonuses for human/elfs or gargoyles.

28-06-2015, Coruja
Changed: REFUSETRADES property now can be only used on players. NPCs won't use it anymore, since NPCs can't open trade windows.
Changed: Huge optimization on NPC_AI_EXTRA code. This is a heavy code called thousands of times per second, so unfortunately some features got removed to improve Sphere performance overall:
	-Animals (brain_animal) wont poop on ground anymore.
	-Animal Trainers (brain_animal_trainer) won't give food to nearby pets anymore.
	-Vendors won't go off-duty (brain_vendor_offduty) at night time anymore.
	PS: If someone still need these features, it can be done by scripts using @NPCAction trigger or at BUY/SELL functions on file /speech/speakshopkeep.scp
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Removed messages 'animal_dung' and 'npc_animal_poop'.

29-06-2015, Coruja
[sphere_defs.scp]: Removed 'brain_beggar', 'brain_thief', 'brain_undead' and 'brain_vendor_offduty'. Unfortunately these NPC brains never had worked correctly so it won't make much difference if they got removed to clean some obsolete internal codes.
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Removed messages 'npc_beggar_*' and 'npc_vendor_offduty'.
[speakhuman.scp]: Changed a single 'brain_thief' line to 'brain_animal_trainer' brain check on train command to match these brain changes [brain_thief -> brain_animal_trainer]
[sphere_backward_compatibility.scp]: Added backward compatibility to these 4 removed NPC brains.
[sphere_skills.scp]: Added (<ISPLAYER>) check on Tracking skill to prevent console error when an NPC try to use this skill.
[sphere_menu.scp]: Updated all obsolete ADDITEM and ADDNPC lines to ADD.

03-07-2015, Coruja

Fixed: Combat creating blood on the attacker instead target.
Fixed: Dragons (brain_dragon) always hitting breath attack even when the target get out of LOS.
Changed: Decreased dragon breath damage. The previous formula was causing too high damages when the dragon has high hitpoints.

[sphere.ini]:
-Added CombatSpeedEra to switch between speed formulas that has been changed over the years, also updated the source to reflect this addition and added fully back the formula for Legacy, it was a little tweaked.
// CombatSpeedEra
// 0 = Legacy, T2A, 55x versions..., Recommended SpeedScaleFactor = 15000, Use DEX by default to calc speed, all others use stam
// 1 = AOS,							 Recommended SpeedScaleFactor = 40000
// 2 = SE, 							 doesn't use m_iSpeedScaleFactor and it's only compatible with ML speed format eg. 0.25 ~ 5.00 seconds instead 0 ~ 50
// 3 = ML, 							 Recommended SpeedScaleFactor = 80000
CombatSpeedEra= 3	// Default is ML (3)

Note that SpeedScaleFactor must be changed along with this setting.
Tweaked CombatFormulas, they were using iDelay/2 when Fighting Skill started and generating another iDelay/2 after that period of time making it impossible to fully rewrite the value under argn1 in @HitTry.

[sphere_backwards_compatibility]:
Added some more items.

09-07-2015, Coruja
Changed: Improved some internal actions to update the client screen using less packets instead always do a full resend.

	-Added missing descriptions on Experimental and OptionFlags features.

16-07-2015, Coruja
Fixed #2538: BOUNCE function not activating item decay if it got dropped on ground by overweight.
Fixed: NPCs Healer (brain_healer) resurrecting dead bonded pets (only the pet owner can resurrect it).
Fixed: Combat hit chance formula being called twice, resulting a double chance to miss the attack.

17-07-2015, Coruja
Added: New improved NPC looting AI (NPC_AI_LOOTING).
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Added 'loot_rummage' and removed 'loot_item_from', 'skillact_looting' messages.

24-07-2015, XuN
Added TAG.OVERRIDE.SPEED for ITEMDEFS and Items overriding the current speed for weapons.
Fixed #2535: NPCRestock is now accepting code like any other triggers.
Added: Setting RegenX=-1 in the ini will disable regens for that stat, also the @RegenStat trigger and every related code.
[Items/Sphere_item_provisions_weapons.scp]:
	-Added TAG.OVERRIDE.SPEED for all weapons to match new speeds on OSI, uncomment these lines to enable them (These speeds are meant to be used with CombatSpeedEra=3).
Re-added detail check for parrying messages, they were being sent always regardless of the detail flag on the character.
Re-Adeed EF_Intrinsic_Locals with a warning comment in the ini.
Fixed a check in CChar::NPC_ExtraAI() giving errors when trying to find items inside a container when there was no container to search on.

25-07-2015, Coruja
Changed: Optimized many spells and some others functions to avoid send unnecessary 'update' packets to client when it's not needed (or send it using less packets when needed).

26-07-2015, XuN
Enabled again movement packet for newer clients since blocking it was causing newer clients to do not move at all and getting 'freezed' after some steps. Added a few lines of code to UserChatButton to make this packet restrict movement when this button is being pressed, hence avoiding these injection problems.

26-07-2015, Ben
Added support for future Axis connection... (details will be available when the time comes)
Added internal support for Category,Subsection.Description and ID in SPAWN and TEMPLATE sections. they can now be accessed with (eg: serv.spawn.defname_here.category)
Also added access to ID in CHARDEF to return the real anim id of the chardef in hex. (serv.chardef.c_man.id should return 0190)

28-07-2015, Coruja
[sphere_skills.scp]: Updated TITLE on skills ArmsLore, Blacksmithing and MagicResistance.
[spheretables.scp]:
	-Updated RESOURCES using an better file order to prevent some 'undefined keyword' errors on sphere startup.
	-Fixed a small notoriety typo [Imfamous -> Infamous]

04-08-2015, Coruja
[Sphere.ini]: Added new magic flag MAGICF_OVERRIDEFIELDS to prevent cast multiple field spells on the same tile, making the new field tile remove the previous field.
Changed: If there's multiple field spells on the same tile and MAGICF_OVERRIDEFIELDS is disabled, now only the first field will make effect (this will prevent some weird exploits like cast multiple Fire Field spells on the same tile to take more damage, etc).

06-08-2015, Coruja
Fixed #2541: Client screen not being updated correctly on resurrect.
Fixed: Players randomly switching to previous targets on combat.
Fixed: Client sending unnecessary mana/stam update to party members when opening the status menu.
Added: Missing Polymorph spell duration formula when MAGICF_OSIFORMULAS feature is enabled.

07-08-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Random 'walk resync' problems.
Fixed: Incorrect full update packet sent to clients when it' ID (body) got changed.
Fixed: Combat swings between attacks not working correctly.
Fixed #2539: Combat damages always creating blood using default color (red) instead follow BLOODCOLOR property.

09-08-2015, Coruja
Changed: Major improvements and optimizations on internal Hit / HitTry combat calls.
Changed: Combat swing behavior got slightly changed to be more accurate.
	-Now instead the animation speed match the swing delay duration and only do the damage at the end, the animation/damage will always occour on first 7ms and then it will keep waiting the remaining time until next swing.
	-This makes all anims/sounds perfectly match the damage timer no matter the weapon type or swing delay timer.

13-08-2015, matex
Added: OVERRIDE.NPCAI to control AI-flags on a per character basis if necessary. Otherwise NPCAI flag from sphere.ini is used.

15-08-2015, matex
Added: EF_DynamicBackgroundsave. This will enable, if necessary, if a backgroundsave tick is triggered to save more than only one Sector. 
This especially makes sense if the map has a lot of sectors. E.g. if the sectorsize deviates from 64x64 as completion of a single backgroundsave
takes circa 40 minutes with a sectorsize of 32x32 and BACKGROUNDSAVE set to 1. Using dynamic backgroundsaving this can be sped up at the cost of
some performance. You can approximately limit the amount of items/characters that will be saved as the Operation will just stop if it estimated that
saving another sector would exceed SaveStepMaxComplexity. You can further limit how many sectors will be saved at maximum per backgroundsave-tick using SaveSectorsPerTick. This is a maximum value. If the maximum complexity is exceeded it may not reach that maximum value.
Added: SECTOR.INACTIVECOUNT. Will report the number of logged-out chararacters inside that sector.

16-08-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Walk packet events causing excessive CPU/bandwidth usage.

17-08-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Char property Regen[Hits/Mana/Stam] not working correctly.
Changed: Updated internal MySQL libs version 4.1.18 to 6.1.6. 

19-08-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Combat randomly not starting the first swing.
Fixed: Rubberband when using combat skills while running.
Fixed: World teleports incorrectly showing teleport spell animation.
Fixed: Tracking skill showing empty messages instead not show any message at all when the tracking messages are blank on sphere_msgs.scp.

21-08-2015, Coruja
Fixed: NPCs (brain_monster) always trying to apply poison on hit, even if the NPC doesn't have poisoning skill or poisoned weapons.
Fixed: NPCs not moving when step on Fire Field spell.
Fixed: Tactics skill too difficult to gain on combat.
Fixed: Explosion potion not flagging criminal when hit someone.
Fixed: Spells disturb not working correctly in some specific cases.
Fixed: Missing paperdoll update when char ID (body) get changed.
[Sphere.ini] Removed COMBAT_PREHIT combat flag, it can be replaced by AttackingIsaCrime which does the same thing.
[sphere_defs.scp]: Added new 'dam_nodisturb' damage flag.

25-08-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Food items not restoring char FOOD correctly.
Fixed: HitLeech[Life/Mana/Stam] and HitManaDrain properties making hits/mana/stam rise over the max char limit.
[sphere_spells.scp]: Removed SOUND / EFFECT_ID from Teleport spell. These values are already handled by Sphere.ini settings, and sphere_spells.scp values was making it play twice.

27-08-2015, Coruja
Added: New STEPSTEALTH char property to set how many steps the char can walk invisible while using Stealth skill. This property is set when using Stealth skill, will decrease -1 on each walk step (or -2 if running) and will reveal when reach 0.
Changed: Trigger @StepStealth no longer use ARGN1 to force reveal, the ARGN1=1 can be replaced by STEPSTEALTH=0.
Fixed: Missing buff icon when using INVIS (GM command).
[sphere_skills.scp]: New Stealth softcoded skill.
	-IMPORTANT: It's HIGHLY recommended update it, or this skill will stop working.

28-08-2015, XuN
Changed the way SPAWNS works, improved them and added more access functions:
	- Removed MEMORY_ISPAWNED from source (still present as a def in sphere_defs.scp for backwards-compat)
	- Updated SpawnItem to point directly to the spawn instead of redirecting to memory's link.
	- Moved SpawnItem (R) to COjbBase to affect both chars and items.
	- Spawned OBJs are now stored in the spawn, so SpawnItem only gives quick access to the spawn.
	- Functions added to spawns:
		- AT.n.KEY (R): Retrieves the 'KEY' val for the 'n' spawned item/char, examples: <at.0.name>, <at.0.str>...
		- COUNT (R): Returns the total count of spawned items or chars.
		- RESET (W): Removes every spawned Item/Char.
		- STOP (W): Removes every spawned Item/Char and stops the Spawn.
		- START (W): Same as DClicking the Spawn, but from function, without LOS/Distance/etc limitations (It just makes it start, doesn't reset it, so won't work if it's already working).
		- ADDOBJ uid (W): Adds the given UID(the Item/Char must exist obviously, so it must be created before) to the Spawned list, it doesn't check for MORE2 < AMOUNT or anything, it's a forced add. Example:
				ON=@GetHit
					REF1=<SpawnItem>
					SERV.NEWNPC=<baseid>
					NEW.P=<P>
					NEW.FLAGS |= STATF_CONJURED
					REF1.ADDOBJ=<NEW>
		- DELOBJ uid (W): The opossite of ADDOBJ, removes one OBJ from this list (just remove from the list, it's not removing the OBJ itself).
NOTE: While updating for this build, when server is loading for first time and converting MEMORY_ISPAWNED to SpawnItem and removing these memories, Sphere will throw a memory_leak exception after loading the world because of the difference between items before loading (chars with memory_ispawned) and items after loading (memory_ispawned removed).

Added PREVBUILD storing in the worldsaves the current BUILD (__GITREVISION__), usefull to apply changes when updating the bin. Usage: <SERV.PrevBuild>


Changed iSwingDelay from CChar::Fight_Hit to CResource::Calc_CombatAttackSpeed to prevent double checks for speeds 'lower than' and to avoid guard's speed to be overriden if GuardsInstantKill=1
Also changed AnimDelay from @HitTry to initially have a duration of argn1 -=7, so this can be softcoded to match 'old style' by just adding a simple +=7
Updated fighting delays to match again the 'real' delay removing a tick from the delay (as the fighting proccess is starting in the next tick).
Fixed #2554: SkillUseQuick not checking for SKF_SCRIPTED
Fixed #2553: Animations not being displayed when fighting with COMBATF_NODIRCHANGE
Fixed #2547: Dragons will be tracked as Monsters
Fixed Tracking not displaying the direction of the target in the given message.
Fixed ML SpeedEra's formula not giving correct delays.
