ON=RING
SAY=Most rings are ordinary, but I have heard of special rings which increase one's strength in battle.
ON=SHIELD
SAY=The Chaos Shield yields more protection than the Order Shield.
ON=SKILL
SAY=Some weapons require great skill in a given area, like Swordsmanship, Fencing or Mace Fighting.
ON=SPEAR
SAY=Bah. Spears better for catching fish.
ON=STAFF
SAY=A black staff does more damage than a gnarled staff, but isn't as fast.
ON=SWORD
SAY=A long sword is my favorite weapon for damage and it requires less frequent repairs than the faster cutlass.
