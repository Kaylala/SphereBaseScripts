SAY=Fish?!?  Go ask one of those reeking, wretched fisherman about them!
ON=FOWL
SAY=That term best describes harpies, certainly. Truly 'foul fowl.' A little ranger joke, friend. *nyuk nyuk*
ON=GARGOYLE
SAY=Those beasts still manage to produce quite a stench despite being made of stone.
ON=GOAT
SAY=Speak not of my mother in such a manner!
ON=GORILLA
SAY=Gorillas are ferocious to be sure, but more easily killed than thou might suspect!
ON=HIDE
SAY=Several animals yield a valuable hide... Cows and Llamas yield a rewarding hide.
ON=HORSE
SAY=If you don't feed your horse, he may leave you stranded! Always pack fruit or grain for a snack.
ON=HUNT
SAY=Tracking is valuable when starting a hunt, but do not bother trying to catch up with a running wolf.
ON=LLAMA
SAY= Overrated pack animal, in my estimation. Better to skin them and sell the hide and meat.
ON=MEAT
SAY=Most meats may be sold to a butcher, but do not bother hunting small prey for this purpose. Your efforts will yield little.
ON=MONSTER
SAY=Some call giant spiders and scorpions monsters, but they are actually quite friendly when tamed.
ON=MOUNTAIN CAT
SAY=Ah! My favorite travelling companion, a fierce friend.  Oh, well a tamed one, of course.

SAY=Pigs? Oh, yes, my inlaws live but a short way over yonder.
ON=RABBIT

ON=RANGER
SAY=We dedicate our lives as rangers to learing about the habits of animals.
ON=SEAL
SAY=Slimy beasts, but surprisingly tasty.
ON=SHEEP
SAY=You may shear a sheap with shearing scissors but once every day. Spin the wool at a tailor's shop for a tidy profit!
ON=SKILL
SAY='Tis said I have many other skill besides tracking... taming for one!
ON=SPIRITUALITY
SAY=Few things are as special as establishing a spiritual bond with animals.
ON=TRACK
SAY='Tis my passion.  There is nothing I can't track.
ON=WOLF
SAY= Bad luck, they are.  Track one and soon you may be faced with the whole pack!
ON=GUILD
SAY=Our guild is made up of Rangers of varying skills and habits.
ON=JOIN
SAY=Ah... we are not accepting members at this time.  My apologies.
ON=MASTER
SAY=A Master Ranger may tame or track even a dragon!
//RANDOM= All of life is a great hunt!  Except, of course, for brothels. That is like shooting fish in a barrel...
